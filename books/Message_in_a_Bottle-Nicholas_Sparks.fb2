        <annotation><p>Everything starts on a warm summer evening, shortly after the rain. A carefully sealed bottle is thrown overboard. It is supposed to break but falls into the warm water. Despite the strong current, underwater reefs and big waves, this bottle remains intact. It contains a very important message that can change the fate of several people. The bottle often changes directions due to strong winds. Sometimes it tangles up in fishing nets. According to a widespread belief, such bottles usually contain messages about lost treasures. But there is nothing like this in this bottle. A letter is hidden in it. Thanks to it, two people will meet in the future. This meeting will change their lives forever.</p></annotation>

<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
<p>The bottle was dropped overboard on a warm summer evening, a few hours before the rain began to fall. It was sealed properly and sent to sea. It could float safely through hurricanes or tropical storms. It was, in a way, the ideal home for the message it carried inside, a message that had been sent to fulfill a promise.</p>
<p>Its course was unpredictable. For six days, it slowly floated in a northeasterly direction. On the seventh day the winds died, and the bottle steered itself directly eastward, eventually finding its way to the Gulf Stream, where it then picked up speed, traveling north at almost seventy miles per day.</p>
<p>Two and a half weeks after its launch, the bottle still followed the Gulf Stream. On the seventeenth day, however, another storm brought easterly winds strong enough to drive the bottle from the current, and the bottle began to drift toward New England. Without the Gulf Stream forcing it along, the bottle slowed again and zigzagged in various directions near the Massachusetts shore.</p>
<p>The bottle drifted back and forth for a few days - as if deciding where to go before choosing its course - and it finally washed up along the shore on a beach near Chatham.</p>
<p>And there, after 26 days and 738 miles, it ended its journey.</p>

<p><strong>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE</strong></p>
<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
<p>A cold December wind was blowing, and Theresa Osborne crossed her arms as she stared out over the water. She was alone on the beach. The ocean, reflecting the color of the sky, looked like liquid iron, and waves rolled up steadily on the shore.</p>
<p>She'd driven here this morning. When she'd made the decision to come, she'd planned to stay overnight. She'd made the arrangements and had even looked forward to a quiet night away from Boston, but watching the ocean she realized that she didn't want to stay. She wanted to drive home as soon as she was finished.</p>
<p>When she was finally ready, Theresa slowly started to walk toward the water. Beneath her arm, she carried a bag that she had carefully packed that morning, making sure that she hadn't forgotten anything. She hadn't told anyone what she carried with her. She hadn't told them what she'd intended to do today, either. Instead, she'd said that she was going Christmas shopping. It was the perfect excuse, and this trip was something she didn't want to share with anyone. It had started with her alone, and that was the same way she wanted it to end.</p>
<p>Theresa sighed and checked her watch. Soon it would be high tide, and then she would finally be ready. After finding a spot on a small dune that looked comfortable, she sat in the sand and opened her bag. Searching through it, she found the envelope she wanted. There were three letters in it, carefully folded, letters that she'd read many times. Holding them in front of her, she sat on the sand and stared at them.</p>
<p>He had used a fountain pen when he'd written them, and there were smudges in various places where the pen had leaked. The paper, with its picture of a sailing ship in the upper right-hand corner, was beginning to discolor in places, fading slowly with the passage of time. She knew there would come a day when the words would be impossible to read, but hopefully, after today, she wouldn't feel the need to look at them so often.</p>
<p>When she finished, she slipped them back into the envelope as carefully as she'd removed them. Then, after putting the envelope back into the bag, she looked at the beach again. From where she was sitting, she could see the place where it had all started.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She'd been jogging at daybreak, she remembered. It was the beginning of a beautiful day. Even though she was on vacation, she had risen early enough to run so that she didn't have to watch where she was going. In a few hours, the beach would be packed with tourists lying on their towels in the hot New England sun. Cape Cod was always crowded at that time of year, but most vacationers tended to sleep a little later, and she enjoyed the sensation of jogging on the hard, smooth sand.</p>
<p>She had always liked to jog; running was now one of the few times she could be alone with her thoughts. She considered it a kind of meditation, which was why she liked to do it alone. She never could understand why people liked to run in groups.</p>
<p>Though she loved her son, she was glad Kevin wasn't with her. Every mother needs a break sometimes. She had taken him to the airport three days ago to catch a plane to visit his father - her ex - in California.</p>
<p>Kevin was twelve. He had been looking forward to this trip since last Christmas. He and his father were going to the Grand Canyon, then would spend a week rafting down the Colorado River, and finally go on to Disneyland. It was every kid's fantasy trip, and she was happy for him. Although he would be gone for six weeks, she knew it was good for Kevin to spend time with his father.</p>
<p>She and David had been on relatively good terms since they'd divorced three years ago. Although he wasn't the greatest husband, he was a good father to Kevin. He never missed sending a birthday or Christmas gift, called weekly, and traveled across the country a few times a year just to spend weekends with his son. They spent six weeks every summer, every other Christmas, and Easter break when school let out for a week. Annette, David's new wife, was busy with the baby, but Kevin liked her a lot, and he had never returned home feeling angry or neglected.</p>
<p>Now, on the beach, she went for a short run before breakfast with Deanna, her friend. Brian, Deanna's husband, would already be gone, she knew - and Theresa looked forward to talking with her. They were an older couple - both of them we're about sixty now - but Deanna was the best friend she had.</p>
<p>The managing editor at the newspaper where Theresa worked, Deanna had been coming to the Cape with Brian, for years. They always stayed in the same place, the Fisher House, and when she found out that Kevin was leaving to visit his father in California for a good portion of the summer, she insisted that Theresa come along. "Brian golfs every day he's here, and I'd like the company," she'd said. "Besides, what else are you going to do? You've got to get out of that apartment sometime.' Theresa knew she was right, and after a few days of thinking it over, she finally agreed. "I'm so glad," Deanna had said with a victorious look on her face. "You're going to love it there."</p>
<p>Theresa had to admit it was a nice place to stay. The Fisher House was a beautifully restored captain's house that sat on the edge of a rocky cliff overlooking Cape Cod Bay, and when she saw it in the distance, she slowed. At thirty-six, she didn't recover as fast as she once had.</p>
<p>As her breathing eased, she thought about how she would spend the rest of her day. She had brought five books with her for the vacation. She just didn't have enough time anymore - not with Kevin and his never-ending energy, doing the housework, and definitely not with all the work constantly piled on her desk. As a syndicate columnist for the Boston Times, she was under constant deadline pressure to put out three columns a week. And because the syndication offers had started only eighteen months ago and she was a newcomer to most papers, she couldn't afford even a few "off" days. Column space in most newspapers was extremely limited, and hundreds of columnists were competing for those few spots.</p>
<p>Theresa slowed to a walk and finally stopped. She took off her shoes and socks, and then walked to the water's edge to let the tiny waves lap over her feet. The water was refreshing.</p>
<p>She was suddenly glad she had taken the time to write extra columns over the last few months so that she would be able to forget work this week. She couldn't remember the last time she didn't have a computer nearby, or a meeting to attend, or a deadline to meet, and it felt liberating to be away from her desk for a while. It almost felt as if she were in control of her own destiny again, as if she were just starting out in the world.</p>
<p>True, there were dozens of things she knew she should do at home. The bathroom needed to be wallpapered and updated by now. A couple of months ago she had bought the wallpaper and some paint, a new mirror, as well as all the tools she needed to take care of it, but she hadn't even opened the boxes yet. It was always something to do next weekend, though the weekends were often just as busy as her workdays. The items she bought still sat in the bags she'd brought them home in. Maybe, she thought to herself, when she returned home...</p>
<p>She stepped out a little farther into the water and closed her eyes, but the only thing she could think about was Kevin. Lord knew she wanted to spend more time with him, and she definitely wanted to be more patient with him when they were together. She wanted to be able to sit and talk with Kevin, or simply watch TV with him. But the problem was that there was always something to do. There were dishes to be washed, bathrooms to be cleaned, the cat box to be emptied; laundry needed to be done, and bills had to be paid. Even though Kevin helped a lot with his chores, he was almost as busy as she was with school and friends, and all his other activities.</p>
<p>But how to change all that? "Take life one day at a time," her mother always said, but her mother didn't have to work outside the home or raise a strong and confident yet caring son without benefit of a father. She didn't understand the pressures that Theresa faced. Neither did her younger sister, Janet. She and her husband had been happily married for almost eleven years, and they had three wonderful girls. Edward wasn't a brilliant man, but he was honest, worked hard, and provided for his family well enough that Janet didn't have to work. There were times when Theresa thought she might like a life like that, even if it meant giving up her career.</p>
<p>But that wasn't possible. Not since David and she divorced. Three years now. She didn't hate David for what he had done, but her respect for him had been shattered. Adultery wasn't something she could live with. It didn't make her feel better that he never married the woman he'd been having an affair with for two years. Her trust was betrayed.</p>
<p>David moved back to his home state of California a year after they separated and met Annette a few months later. His new wife was very religious, and little by little, she got David interested in the church. Now he attended church regularly and actually served as a marriage counselor along with the pastor. What could he possibly say to someone doing the same things he'd done, she often wondered, and how could he help others if he hadn't been able to control himself? She didn't know, didn't care, really. She was simply glad that he still took an interest in his son.</p>
<p>Naturally, once she and David had split up, a lot of her friendships ended as well. A few friends remained, though, and she heard from them on her answering machine, suggesting that they set up a lunch date or come over for dinner. Occasionally she agreed to go, but usually she made excuses not to. To her, none of those friendships seemed the way they used to, but then of course they weren't. Things changed, people changed, and the world went rolling along right outside the window.</p>
<p>Since the divorce there had been only a few dates. It wasn't that she was unattractive. She was, or so she was often told. Her hair was dark brown, cut just above her shoulders, and straight as spider silk. Her eyes, the feature she was most often complimented on, were brown with flecks of hazel that caught the light when she was outside. Since she ran daily, she was fit and didn't look as old as she was. She didn't feel old, either, but when she looked in the mirror lately, she seemed to see her age catching up with her.</p>
<p>Now, with three years gone by, she honestly didn't know if she would ever love someone again the way she had loved David. When she first saw David at a party at the beginning of her junior year, one look was all it took for her to know she wanted to be with him. Her young love had seemed so overwhelming, so powerful, then. She would stay awake thinking about him as she lay in her bed, and when she walked across campus, she smiled so often that other people would smile back whenever they saw her.</p>
<p>But love like that doesn't last; at least that's what she found out. Over the years, a different kind of marriage emerged. She and David grew up, and apart. It became hard to remember the things that had first drawn them to each other. Looking back, Theresa felt that David became a different person altogether, although she couldn't see the moment when it all began to change. But anything can happen when the flame of a relationship goes out, and for him, it did.</p>
<p>The unfair thing about the whole situation was that she still missed him sometimes. She had gotten used to waking up to the smell of coffee in the morning. She missed a lot of things, but most of all she missed the intimacy that came from holding and whispering to another behind closed doors.</p>
<p>She still dreamed about falling in love with someone, of having someone take her in his arms and make her feel she was the only one who mattered. But it was hard, if not impossible, to meet someone decent these days. Most of the men she knew in their thirties were already married, and the ones that were divorced seemed to be looking for someone younger whom they could somehow mold into exactly what they wanted. That left older men, and even though she thought she could fall in love with someone older, she had her son to worry about. She wanted a man who would treat Kevin the way he should be treated, not simply as the unwanted by-product of someone he desired. But the reality was that older men usually had older children; few welcomed the trials of raising an adolescent male in the 1990s. "I've already done my job," a man had once informed her curtly. That had been the end of that relationship.</p>
<p>She admitted that she also missed the physical intimacy that came from loving and trusting and holding someone else. She hadn't been with a man since she and David divorced. There had been opportunities, of course - finding someone to sleep with was never difficult for an attractive woman - but that simply wasn't her style. She hadn't been raised that way and she didn't intend to change now. Sex was too important, too special, to be shared with just anyone. In fact, she had slept with only two men in her life - David, of course, and Chris, the first real boyfriend she'd ever had. She didn't want to add to the list simply for the sake of a few minutes of pleasure.</p>
<p>So now, vacationing at Cape Cod, alone in the world and without a man anywhere in the foreseeable future, she wanted to do some things this week just for herself. Read some books, have a glass of wine, write some letters to friends she hadn't heard from in a while. Sleep late, eat too much, and jog in the mornings, before everyone got there to spoil it. She wanted to experience freedom again, if only for a short time.</p>
<p>She also wanted to shop this week - at little stores that Kevin found boring. She wanted to try on some new dresses and buy a couple that flattered her figure, just to make her feel she was still alive and vibrant. And if a nice guy happened to ask her out this week, maybe she'd go, just to have an excuse to wear the new things she bought.</p>
<p>With a somewhat renewed sense of optimism, she started toward the house. She walked close to the water's edge and saw a large rock half-buried in the sand. "Strange " she thought to herself, "it seems out of place here."</p>
<p>As she approached, she noticed something different about the way it looked. It was smooth and long, for one thing, and as she drew nearer, she realized it wasn't a rock at all. It was a bottle, probably discarded by a careless tourist. She looked over her shoulder and saw a garbage can chained to the lifeguard tower and decided to do her good deed for the day. When she reached it, however, she was surprised to see that it was corked. She picked it up, holding it into better light, and saw a note inside wrapped with yarn, standing on its end.</p>
<p>For a second she felt her heart quicken as another memory came back to her. When she was eight years old and vacationing in Florida with her parents, she and another girl had once sent a letter via the sea, but she'd never received a reply. The letter was simple, a child's letter, but when she returned home, she remembered racing to the mailbox for weeks afterward, hoping that someone had found it and sent a letter to her from where the bottle washed up. When nothing ever came, she was really disappointed.</p>
<p>She began to pull at the cork, almost expecting it to be the same bottle she had sent, although she knew that couldn't be. It was probably from another child, though, and if it requested a reply, she was going to send it. Maybe along with a small gift from the Cape and a postcard as well.</p>
<p>The cork was stuck, and her fingers slipped as she tried to open it. Finally, the cork loosened and she opened the bottle. Then she tipped the bottle upside-down and the note dropped to the sand by her feet almost immediately. When she leaned over to pick it up, she noticed it was tightly bound, which was why it slid out so easily.</p>
<p>She untied the yarn carefully, and the first thing that struck her as she unrolled the message was the paper. This was no child's stationery. It was expensive paper, thick and sturdy, with a silhouette of a sailing ship stamped in the upper right-hand corner. And the paper itself was aged looking, almost as if it had been in the water for a hundred years.</p>
<p>She caught herself holding her breath. Maybe it was old. Maybe she had a real artifact here. But soon she saw that she was mistaken. There was a date on the upper left-hand corner of the paper.</p>
<p>July 22, 1997.</p>
<p>A little more than three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Three weeks? That's all?</p>
<p>She looked a little further. The message was long - it covered the front and back sides of the paper. A quick glance showed no address or phone number anywhere.</p>
<p>She felt curious as she held the message in front of her, and then, in the rising sunlight of a hot New England day, she first read the letter that would change her life forever.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>My Dearest Catherine,</p>
<p>I miss you, my darling, as I always do, but today is especially hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together. I can almost feel you beside me as I write this letter, and I can smell the scent of wild flowers that always reminds me of you. But at this moment, these things give me no pleasure. Your visits have been coming less often, and I feel sometimes as if the greatest part of who I am is slowly slipping away.</p>
<p>I am trying, though. At night when I am alone, I call for you, and whenever my ache seems to be the greatest, you still seem to find a way to return to me. Last night, in my dreams, I saw you on the pier near Wrightsville Beach. The wind was blowing through your hair. I am struck as I see you leaning against the rail. You are beautiful, I think as I see you, a vision that I can never find in anyone else. I slowly begin to walk toward you, and when you finally turn to me, I notice that others have been watching you as well. "Do you know her?" they ask me in jealous whispers, and as you smile at me, I simply answer with the truth. "Better than my own heart."</p>
<p>I stop when I reach you and take you in my arms. I long for this moment more than any other. It is what I live for, and when you return my embrace, I feel peace once again.</p>
<p>I raise my hand and gently touch your cheek and you tilt your head and close your eyes. My hands are hard and your skin is soft, and I wonder for a moment if you'll pull back, but of course, you don't. You never have, and it is at times like this that I know what my purpose is in life.</p>
<p>I am here to love you, to hold you in my arms, to protect you. I am here to learn from you and to receive your love in return. I am here because there is no other place to be.</p>
<p>But then, as always, the mist starts to form as we stand close to one another. A distant fog rises from the horizon, and I find that I grow fearful as it approaches. Like a rolling cloud, it blankets everything, closing, until there is nothing left but the two of us.</p>
<p>I feel my throat begin to close and my eyes well up with tears because I know it is time for you to go. The look you give me at that moment haunts me. I feel your sadness and my own loneliness, and the ache in my heart that had been silent for only a short time grows stronger as you release me. And then you spread your arms, step back into the fog, because it is your place and not mine. I want to go with you, but your only response is to shake your head because we both know that is impossible.</p>
<p>And I watch with breaking heart as you slowly fade away. I find myself straining to remember everything about this moment, everything about you. But soon, always too soon, your image vanishes and the fog rolls back to its faraway place and I am alone on the pier and I do not care what others think as I bow my head and cry and cry and cry.</p>
<p>Garrett</p>

<p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
<p>"Have you been crying?" Deanna asked as Theresa stepped onto the back deck, carrying both the bottle and the message. In her confusion, she had forgotten to throw the bottle away.</p>
<p>Theresa felt embarrassed and wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>"Are you okay? What happened out there? Are you hurt?"</p>
<p>Theresa shook her head. "No, nothing like that. I just found this letter and... The letter was in a bottle. I found it washed up on the beach. When I opened it and read it..."</p>
<p>Deanna's face lightened just a bit. "Oh... that's good. For a second I thought something awful happened. Like someone had attacked you or something." She paused for a moment. "You said the letter made you cry? Why? What did it say?"</p>
<p>Theresa handed the letter to Deanna.</p>
<p>Deanna read the letter slowly, and when she finished, she looked up at Theresa. Her eyes too were watering.</p>
<p>"It's... it's beautiful," Deanna finally said. "It's one of the most touching things I've ever read."</p>
<p>"That's what I thought."</p>
<p>"And you found it washed up on the beach? When you were running?"</p>
<p>Theresa nodded.</p>
<p>"That's strange. The bay is sheltered from the rest of the ocean, and I've never heard of Wrightsville Beach."</p>
<p>"It looked like it had washed up last night. I almost walked by it at first before I noticed what it was."</p>
<p>Deanna ran her finger over the writing and paused for a moment. "I wonder who they are. And why was it sealed in a bottle?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Aren't you curious?"</p>
<p>The fact was that Theresa was indeed curious. Immediately after reading it, she had read it again, then a third time. What would it be like, she thought, to have someone love her that way?</p>
<p>"A little. But so what? There's no way we'll ever know."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do with it?"</p>
<p>"Keep it, I guess. I haven't really thought about it that much."</p>
<p>"Hmmm," Deanna said with an indecipherable smile.</p>
<p>The two women talked about the places they might go. Then Deanna got up and went inside for another cup of coffee and Theresa watched her as she left.</p>
<p>Deanna was fifty-eight and round faced, with hair that was slowly turning to gray. She was, Theresa decided, the best person she knew. She was knowledgeable about music and art, and at work, the recordings of Mozart or Beethoven were always flooding out of her office into the chaos of the newsroom. She lived in a world of optimism and humor, and everyone who knew her adored her.</p>
<p>When Deanna came back to the table, she sat down and looked out across the bay. "Isn't this the most beautiful place you've ever seen?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is. I'm glad you invited me."</p>
<p>"You needed it."</p>
<p>Deanna reached across the table and picked up the letter again. As she read it her eyebrows raised, but she said nothing. To Theresa, it looked as though the letter had triggered something in her memory.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I just wonder...," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"Wonder what?"</p>
<p>"Well, when I was inside, I was thinking about this letter. I'm wondering if we should run this in your column this week."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>Deanna leaned across the table. "Just what I said - I think we should run this letter in your column this week. I'm sure other people would love to read it. It really is unusual. People need to read something like this occasionally. And this is so touching. I can picture a hundred women cutting it out and taping it to their refrigerators so their husbands can see it when they get home from work."</p>
<p>"We don't even know who they are. Don't you think we should get their permission first?"</p>
<p>"That's just the point. We can't. I can talk to the attorney at the paper, but I'm sure it's legal."</p>
<p>"I know it's probably legal, but I'm not sure if it's right. I mean, this is a very personal letter. I'm not sure it should be spread around so that everyone can read it."</p>
<p>"It's a human interest story, Theresa. People love those sorts of things. Besides, there's nothing in there that might be embarrassing to someone. This is a beautiful letter. And remember, this person sent it in a bottle in the ocean. He had to know it would wash up somewhere."</p>
<p>Theresa shook her head. "I don't know, Deanna..."</p>
<p>"Well, sleep on it if you have to. I think it's a great idea."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theresa thought about the letter as she undressed and got in the shower. She was wondering about the man who wrote it - Garrett, if that was his real name. And who was Catherine? His lover or his wife, obviously, but she wasn't around anymore. Was she dead, she wondered, or did something else happen that forced them apart? And why was it sealed in a bottle and set adrift? The letter obviously came from the heart. And to think that a man wrote it! In all her years, she had never received a letter even close to that. "What would such a man be like?" she thought.</p>
<p>She looked at herself in the mirror as she toweled off. Not too bad for a thirty-six-year-old with an adolescent son, she thought to herself. Her stomach was flat, and her legs were long and lean from all the exercise over the years. She was pleased with how she looked this morning.</p>
<p>After putting on a little makeup, she dressed in beige shorts, a sleeveless white blouse, and brown sandals. It would be hot and humid in another hour, and she wanted to be comfortable as she walked around Provincetown.</p>
<p>Outside on the deck, Deanna had set breakfast on the table. There was a melon and grapefruit, along with toasted bagels. After taking her seat, she spread some low-fat cream cheese on them - Deanna was on one of her endless diets again - and the two of them talked for a long while. Brian was out golfing.</p>
<p>Brian and Deanna had been together thirty-six years. College sweethearts, they'd married the summer after graduation, right after Brian accepted a job with an accounting firm in Boston. Eight years later Brian became a partner and they bought a spacious house in Brooklyn, where they had lived alone for the past twenty-eight years.</p>
<p>They had always wanted children, but after six years of marriage, they discovered that having a child was impossible. They tried to adopt for several years, but the list seemed never-ending, and they eventually gave up hope. Deanna turned to work to fill the void in her life. She started at the Boston Times when women were rare and gradually worked her way up the corporate ladder. When she became managing editor ten years ago, she began to take women reporters under her wing. Theresa had been her first student.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Theresa and Deanna went shopping. Theresa bought three new outfits and a new swimsuit. When they returned to the house, Brian was reading the paper in the living room.</p>
<p>Theresa left the two of them alone for the rest of the afternoon. Since the day was still warm, she changed into the new suit she had bought, grabbed a towel and small fold-up chair and went to the beach.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the sun went down, the three of them drove to Hyannis and had dinner at Sam's Crabhouse, a thriving restaurant that deserved its reputation. It was crowded and they had to wait an hour for seats, but the steamed crabs were worth it. Toward the end of dinner, Brian asked about the letter that had washed up.</p>
<p>"I read it when I got back from golfing. Deanna had pinned it to the refrigerator."</p>
<p>Deanna shrugged and laughed. She turned to Theresa with an "I told you someone would do that" look in her eyes but said nothing.</p>
<p>"It washed up on the beach. I found it when I was jogging"</p>
<p>Brian finished his beer and went on. "The letter seemed so sad."</p>
<p>"I know. That's how I felt when I read it."</p>
<p>"Do you know where Wrightsville Beach is?"</p>
<p>"No. I've never heard of it."</p>
<p>"It's in North Carolina," Brian said as he reached into a pocket for a cigarette. "I had a golf trip down there once Great courses."</p>
<p>Theresa asked, "Where in North Carolina?"</p>
<p>Brian lit his cigarette and inhaled. As he exhaled, he spoke.</p>
<p>"Near Wilmington - or actually, it might even be a part of it - I'm not exactly sure about the boundaries. If you're driving, it's about an hour and a half north of Myrtle Beach Have you ever heard of the movie Cape Fear?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"The Cape Fear River is in Wilmington, and that's where the movie was set. Actually, a lot of movies are filmed there. Most of the major studios have a presence in town. Wrightsville Beach is an island right off the coast. Very developed - it's almost a resort community now. It's where a lot of the stars stay while they're on location filming."</p>
<p>"But why have I never heard of it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I guess it doesn't get much attention because of Myrtle Beach, but it's popular down south. The beaches are beautiful - white sand, warm water. It's a great place to spend a week if you ever get the chance."</p>
<p>Theresa didn't respond, and Deanna spoke.</p>
<p>"So, now we know where our mystery writer is from."</p>
<p>Theresa shrugged. "I suppose so, but there's still no way to tell for sure. Maybe it was a place where they vacationed or visited. It doesn't mean he lives there."</p>
<p>Deanna shook her head. "I don't think so. The way the letter was written - it just seemed like his dream was too real to include a place he had only been to once or twice."</p>
<p>She reached over to Brian's hand, took the cigarette, breathed deeply, and kept it as her own. She had done this for years. In her mind, because she didn't light it, she wasn't officially addicted. Brian, without seeming to notice what she had done, lit another. Deanna leaned forward.</p>
<p>"Have you given any more thought to having the letter published?"</p>
<p>"Not really. I still don't know if it's a good idea."</p>
<p>"How about if we don't use their names - just their initials? We can even change the name of Wrightsville Beach, if you want to."</p>
<p>"Why is this so important to you?"</p>
<p>"Because I know a good story when I see one. More than that, I think that this would be meaningful to a lot of people. Nowadays, people are so busy that romance is slowly dying out. This letter shows that it's still possible."</p>
<p>After a long moment, Theresa finally responded.</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>"You'll do it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but like you said, we'll use only their initials and we'll omit the part about Wrightsville Beach. And I'll write a couple of sentences to introduce it."</p>
<p>"I'm so glad," Deanna cried with girlish enthusiasm. "I knew you would. We'll fax it in tomorrow."</p>
<p>Later that night, Theresa wrote out the beginning of the column in longhand on some stationery she found in the desk drawer. When she was finished, she set the two pages on the bedstand behind her, and then crawled into bed. That night she slept badly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The following day, Theresa and Deanna went into Chatham and had the letter typed in a print shop. Since neither of them had brought their portable computers, it seemed like the most logical thing to do. When the column was ready, they faxed it in. It would run in the next day's paper.</p>
<p>The rest of the morning and afternoon were spent like the day before - shopping, relaxing at the beach, easy conversation, and a delicious dinner. When the paper arrived early the next morning, Theresa was the first to read it. She woke early, finished her run before Deanna and Brian were up, then opened the paper and read the column.</p>
<p>Four days ago, while I was on vacation, I was listening to some old songs on the radio and heard Sting singing "Message in a Bottle." Spurred to action by his emotional singing, I raced to the beach to find a bottle of my own. Within minutes, I found one, and sure enough, it had a message inside. (Actually, I didn't hear the song first: I made that up for dramatic effect. But I did find a bottle the other morning with a deeply moving message inside.) I haven't been able to get it off my mind, and although it isn't something I'd normally write about, in a time where everlasting love and commitment seem to be in such short supply, I was hoping you would find it as meaningful as I did.</p>
<p>The rest of the column was devoted to the letter. When Deanna joined Theresa for breakfast, she read the column as well before looking at anything else. "Marvelous," she said when she finished. "It looks even better in print than I thought it would. You're going to get a lot of mail from this column."</p>
<p>"Do you think so?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. I'm sure of it."</p>
<p>"Even more than usual?"</p>
<p>"Tons more. I can feel it."</p>
<p>"We'll see," Theresa said as she ate a bagel, not really sure whether to believe Deanna or not, but curious nonetheless.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER THREE</p>
<p>On Saturday, eight days after she'd arrived, Theresa returned to Boston.</p>
<p>She unlocked the door to her apartment and Harvey came running from the back bedroom. He rubbed against her leg, purring softly, and Theresa picked him up and brought him to the refrigerator. She took out a piece of cheese and gave it to Harvey while she stroked his head, grateful that her neighbor Ella had agreed to look after him while she was away.</p>
<p>After unpacking her bags and picking up her keys and mail from Ella, she sorted through the mail. As usual, it was mainly bills, and she put them aside for another time.</p>
<p>There were eight messages on her recorder when she checked it. Two were from men she had dated in the past, asking her to call if she had a chance. She thought about it briefly, and then decided against it. Neither of them was attractive to her, and she didn't feel like going out just because she had a break in her schedule. She also had calls from her mother and sister, and she made a note to call them sometime this week. There were no calls from Kevin. By now, he was rafting and camping with his father somewhere in Arizona.</p>
<p>Without Kevin, the house seemed strangely silent.</p>
<p>She thought about the two weeks of vacation that she still had left this year. She and Kevin could spend some time at the beach because she had promised him they would. But that left another week. She could use it around Christmas, but this year Kevin would be at his father's, so there wasn't much point in that. She hated spending Christmas alone - it had always been her favorite holiday - but she didn't have a choice. Maybe she could go to Bermuda. Jamaica, or somewhere else in the Caribbean but she didn't really want to go alone, and she didn't know who else would go with her.</p>
<p>She finally gave up and decided that if nothing exciting came to mind, she would just save it for the following year. Maybe she and Kevin would go to Hawaii for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The mail on her desk Monday morning was overwhelming. There were almost two hundred letters there when she arrived, and another fifty arrived later that day with the postman. As soon as she walked into the office, Deanna had pointed proudly at the stack. "See, I told you so," she had said with a smile.</p>
<p>Theresa started opening the mail right away. Without exception, they were responses to the letter she had published in her column. Most were from women, though a few men wrote in as well. One by one, she read how much they had been touched by the anonymous letter. Many asked if she knew who the writer was, and a few women suggested that if the man was single, they wanted to marry him.</p>
<p>She discovered that almost every Sunday edition across the country had run the column, and the letters came from as far away as Los Angeles. Six men claimed they had written the letter themselves, and four of them wanted royalties for it - one even threatened legal action. But when she examined their handwriting, none of them even remotely resembled the letter's.</p>
<p>At noon, she went to lunch at her favorite Japanese restaurant, and a couple of people who were dining at other tables mentioned that they had read the column as well. "My wife taped it to the refrigerator door," one man said, which made Theresa laugh out loud.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, she had worked through most of the stack, and she was tired. She hadn't worked on her next column at all, and she felt the pressure building behind her neck, as it usually did when her deadline approached. At five-thirty, she started working on a column about Kevin being away and what that was like for her. It was going better than she expected and she was almost finished when her phone rang.</p>
<p>It was the newspaper's receptionist.</p>
<p>"Hey, Theresa, I know you asked me to hold your calls, and I have been," she started. "It wasn't easy, by the way - you got about sixty calls today. The phone has been ringing off the hook."</p>
<p>"So what's up?"</p>
<p>"This woman keeps calling me. This is the fifth time she's called today, and she called twice last week. She refused to give her name, but I recognize the voice by now. She says she's got to talk to you."</p>
<p>"Can't you just take a message?"</p>
<p>"I've tried that, but she's persistent. She says she's calling long distance, but that she has to talk to you."</p>
<p>Theresa thought for a moment as she stared at the screen in front of her. Her column was almost done - just another couple of paragraphs to go.</p>
<p>"Can't you ask for a phone number where I can reach her?"</p>
<p>"No, she refuses to give me that, either. She's very evasive."</p>
<p>"Do you know what she wants?"</p>
<p>"I don't have any idea. But she sounds coherent - not like a lot of people who've been calling today. One guy asked me to marry him."</p>
<p>Theresa laughed. "Okay, tell her to hold on. I'll be there in a couple of minutes."</p>
<p>"Will do."</p>
<p>"What line is she on?"</p>
<p>"Five."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>Theresa finished the column quickly. She would go over it again as soon as she got off the phone. She picked up the receiver and pressed line five.</p>
<p>"Hello."</p>
<p>The line was silent for a moment. Then, in a soft, melodic voice, the caller asked, "Is this Theresa Osborne?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is." Theresa leaned back in her chair.</p>
<p>"Are you the one that wrote the column about the message in a bottle"</p>
<p>"Yes. How can I help you?"</p>
<p>The caller paused again. Theresa could hear her breathing, as if she were thinking about what to say next. After a moment, the caller asked:</p>
<p>"Can you tell me the names that were in the letter?"</p>
<p>Theresa closed her eyes. "Just another curiosity seeker," she thought. Her eyes went back to the screen and she began to look over the column.</p>
<p>"No, I'm sorry, I can't. That information can't be made public."</p>
<p>The caller was silent again, and Theresa began to grow impatient. She started reading the first paragraph on the screen. Then the caller surprised her.</p>
<p>"Please," she said, "I've got to know."</p>
<p>Theresa looked up from the screen. She could hear an absolute earnestness in the caller's voice.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Theresa said finally, "I really can't."</p>
<p>"Then can you answer a question?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"Was the letter addressed to Catherine and signed by a man named Garrett?"</p>
<p>The caller had Theresa's full attention and she sat up higher in her seat.</p>
<p>"Who is this?" she asked with sudden firmness.</p>
<p>"It is, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Who is this?" Theresa asked again, this time more gently. She heard the caller take a deep breath before she answered.</p>
<p>"My name is Michelle Turner and I live in Norfolk, Virginia."</p>
<p>"How did you know about the letter?"</p>
<p>"My husband is in the navy and he's stationed here. Three years ago, I was walking along the beach here, and I found a letter just like the one you found on your vacation. After reading your column, I knew it was the same person who wrote it. The initials were the same."</p>
<p>Theresa stopped for a moment. It couldn't be, she thought.</p>
<p>'What kind of paper was it written on?"</p>
<p>"The paper was beige, and it had a picture of a sailing ship in the upper right-hand corner."</p>
<p>Theresa felt her heart pick up speed. It still seemed unbelievable to her.</p>
<p>"Your letter had a picture of a ship, too, didn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it did," Theresa whispered.</p>
<p>"I knew it. I knew it as soon as I read your column." Michelle sounded as if a load had been lifted from her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Do you still have a copy of the letter?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. My husband's never seen it, but I take it out now and then just to read it again. It's a little different from the letter you copied in your column, but the feelings are the same."</p>
<p>"Could you fax me a copy?"</p>
<p>"Sure," she said before pausing. "It's amazing, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Theresa whispered, "it is."</p>
<p>After giving the fax number to Michelle, Theresa could barely work on her column. Michelle had to go to a copy store to fax the letter, and forty-six minutes later Theresa heard the fax machine come to life. The first page through was a cover letter from National Copy Service, addressed to Theresa Osborne at the Boston Times.</p>
<p>She watched it as it fell to the tray beneath and heard the sound of the fax machine as it copied the letter line for line. It went quickly - it took only ten seconds to copy a page - but even that wait seemed too long.</p>
<p>She reached for the copies as the fax machine beeped, signaling an end to the transmission. She took them to her desk without reading them and placed them facedown for a couple of minutes, trying to slow her breathing.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she lifted the cover page. A quick glance at the ship's logo proved to her that it was indeed the same writer. She put the page into better light and began to read.</p>

<p>March 6, 1994</p>
<p>My Darling Catherine,</p>
<p>Where are you? And why, I wonder as I sit alone in a darkened house, have we been forced apart?</p>
<p>I don't know the answer to these questions, no matter how hard I try to understand. The reason is plain, but my mind forces me to dismiss it and lam torn by anxiety in all my waking hours. I am lost without you. I am soulless, a drifter without a home, a solitary bird in a flight to nowhere. I am all these things, and I am nothing at all. This, my darling, is my life without you. I long for you to show me how to live again.</p>
<p>I try to remember the way we once were, on the breezy deck of Happenstance. Do you recall how we worked on her together? We became a part of the ocean as we rebuilt her, for we both knew it was the ocean that brought us together. It was times like those that I understood the meaning of true happiness. At night, we sailed on blackened water and I watched as the moonlight reflected your beauty. I would watch you with awe and know in my heart that we'd be together forever. Is it always that way, I wonder, when two people are in love? I don't know, but if my life since you were taken from me is any indication, then I think I know the answers. From now on, I know I will be alone.</p>
<p>I think of you, I dream of you, I conjure you up when I need you most. This is all I can do, but to me it isn't enough. It will never be enough, this I know, yet what else is there for me to do? If you were here, you would tell me, but I have been cheated of even that. You always knew the proper words to ease the pain I felt. You always knew how to make me feel good inside.</p>
<p>Is it possible that you know how I feel without you? When I dream, I like to think you do. Before we came together, I moved through life without meaning, without reason. I know that somehow, every step I took since the moment I could walk was a step toward finding you. We were destined to be together.</p>
<p>But now, alone in my house, I have come to realize that destiny can hurt a person as much as it can bless him, and I find myself wondering why - out of all the people in all the world I could ever have loved - I had to fall in love with someone who was taken away from me.</p>
<p>Garrett</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>After reading the letter, she leaned back in her chair and brought her fingers to her lips. She reached for her purse, found the initial letter, and laid the two next to each other on her desk. She read the first letter, followed by the second one, then read them in reverse order, feeling almost like a spy, as if she were eavesdropping on a private, secret-filled moment.</p>
<p>She slipped the two letters back into her purse while the opening line of the second one rolled through her head.</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>She exited the computer program she used to write her column and chose a program that allowed her to access the Internet. After a moment's hesitation, she typed the words WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH into the search program. In less than five seconds, she had a number of different topics she could choose from.</p>
<p>As she sat staring at the screen, she suddenly felt ridiculous. Even if Deanna had been right and Garrett lived somewhere in the Wrightsville Beach area, it would still be nearly impossible to locate him. Why, then, was she trying to do so?</p>
<p>She knew the reason, of course. The letters were written by a man who loved a woman deeply, a man who was now alone. As a girl, she had come to believe in the ideal man - the prince or knight of her childhood stories. In the real world, however, men like that simply didn't exist. Real people had real plans, real demands, and real expectations about how other people should behave. True, there were good men out there - men who loved with all their hearts and remained steadfast in the face of great obstacles - the type of man she'd wanted to meet since she and David divorced. But how to find such a man?</p>
<p>Here and now, she knew such a man existed - a man who was now alone - and knowing that made something inside her tighten. It seemed obvious that Catherine - whoever she was - was probably dead, or at least missing without explanation. Yet Garrett still loved her enough to send love letters to her for at least three years. If nothing else, he had proven that he was capable of loving someone deeply and, more important, remaining fully faithful - even long after his loved one was gone.</p>
<p>Where are you? It kept ringing through her head.</p>
<p>She didn't know exactly, but he did exist, and one of the things she had learned early in her life was that if you discovered something that made you tighten inside, you had better try to learn more about it. If you simply ignored the feeling, you would never know what might happen, and in many ways that was worse than finding out you were wrong in the first place.</p>
<p>But where would this all lead? And what did it mean? Had the discovery of the letter been somehow fated, or was it simply a coincidence? Or maybe, she thought, it was simply a reminder of what she was missing in her life.</p>
<p>But she was curious about the mysterious writer, and there was no sense in denying it - at least to herself. And because no one else would understand it (how could they, if she didn't?), she decided then and there not to tell anyone about what she was feeling.</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>Deep down she knew the computer searches and fascination with Garrett would lead to nothing at all. It would gradually pass into some sort of unusual story that she would retell time and time again. She would go on with her life - writing her column, spending time with Kevin, doing all the things a single parent had to do.</p>
<p>And she was almost right. Her life would have proceeded exactly as she imagined. But something happened three days later that caused her to get into the unknown with only a suitcase full of clothes and a stack of papers.</p>
<p>She discovered a third letter from Garrett.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER FOUR</p>
<p>The day she discovered the third letter, she had of course expected nothing unusual. It was a typical midsummer day in Boston - hot and humid.</p>
<p>Theresa was in the newsroom, researching a topic on autistic children. The Boston Times had an excellent database of articles published in previous years from a variety of magazines. Through her computer, she could also access the library at Harvard University or Boston University, and the addition of literally hundreds of thousands of articles they had at their disposal made any search much easier and less time-consuming than it had been even a few years ago.</p>
<p>In a couple of hours she had been able to find almost thirty articles written in the last three years that had been published in journals she had never heard of, and six of the titles looked interesting enough to possibly use.</p>
<p>As she was about to turn off her computer, a thought suddenly crossed her mind and she stopped. She sat down at her desk, accessed the database at Harvard again, and typed in the words</p>
<p>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE.</p>
<p>Because articles in the library system were indexed by subject or headline, she chose to scan by headlines to speed up the search. The response surprised her - a dozen different articles had been written on the subject in the last few years. Most of those were published by scientific journals, and their titles suggested that bottles were used to learn about ocean currents. Three articles seemed interesting, though.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She got home late and sat on the couch with the three articles on messages in bottles in front of her.</p>
<p>An article published in Yankee magazine in March of the previous year was the first one she picked up. It related some history about messages in bottles and chronicled stories about bottles that had washed up in New England over the past few years.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the article, she came across two paragraphs that told of a message that had washed up on the beaches of Long Island:</p>
<p>"Most messages sent by bottle usually ask the finder to respond once with little hope of a lifelong correspondence. Sometimes, however, the senders do not want a response. One such letter, a moving tribute to a lost love, was discovered washed up on Long Island last year. In part it read:</p>
<p>Without you in my arms, I feel an emptiness in my soul. I find myself searching the crowds for your face - I know it is an impossibility, but I cannot help myself. My search for you is a never-ending quest that is hopeless. You and I had talked about what would happen if we were forced apart by circumstance, but I cannot keep the promise I made to you that night. I am sorry, my darling, but there will never be another to replace you. The words I whispered to you were folly, but I did not realize it then. You - and you alone - have always been the only thing I wanted, and now that you are gone, I have no desire to find another. Till death do us part, we whispered in the church, and I've come to believe that the words will ring true until the day finally comes when I, too, am taken from this world."</p>
<p>She stopped reading.</p>
<p>It can't be! She found herself staring at the words. It's simply not possible...</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>But... who else could it be?</p>
<p>Another letter? She flipped to the front of the article and looked at the author's name. It had been written by Arthur Shendakin, Ph.D., a professor of history at Boston College, meaning...</p>
<p>He must live in the area.</p>
<p>She jumped up and took the phone book. She thumbed through it, looking for the name. There were fewer than a dozen Shendakins listed, although only two seemed like a possibility. Both had "A" listed as the first initial, and she checked her watch before dialing. Nine-thirty. Late, but not too late. She dialed the first number and waited as the phone started to ring.</p>
<p>Once.</p>
<p>Twice.</p>
<p>Three times.</p>
<p>On the fourth ring, she began to lose hope, but on the fifth ring, she heard the other line pick up.</p>
<p>"Hello," a man said. By the sound of his voice, she thought he was about sixty years old.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat.</p>
<p>"Hello, this is Theresa Osborne of the Boston Times. Is this Arthur Shendakin?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is," he answered, sounding surprised.</p>
<p>"Oh, hi. I was just calling to find out if this is the same Arthur Shendakin who had an article published last year in Yankee magazine about messages in bottles."</p>
<p>"Yes, I wrote that. How can I help you?"</p>
<p>Her hands felt sweaty on the receiver. "I was curious about one of the messages you said had washed up on Long Island. Do you remember which letter I'm talking about?"</p>
<p>"Can I ask why you're interested?"</p>
<p>"Well," she began, "the Times is thinking of doing an article on the same topic, and we were interested in obtaining a copy of the letter."</p>
<p>She winced at her own lie, but telling the truth seemed worse.</p>
<p>He answered slowly. "Well, I don't know. That letter inspired me to write the articles... I'd have to think about it."</p>
<p>Theresa's throat tightened. "So, you have the letter?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I found it a couple of years ago."</p>
<p>"Mr. Shendakin, I know this is an unusual request, but I can tell you that if you let us use the letter, we'd be happy to pay you a small sum. And we don't need the actual letter, just a copy of it."</p>
<p>She could tell the request surprised him.</p>
<p>"How much are we talking about?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. How much do you want?</p>
<p>"We're willing to offer three hundred dollars, and of course, you'll be properly credited as the person who found it."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, considering. Theresa continued talking before he could formulate a rejection.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shendakin, I'm sure there's a part of you that's worried about the similarity between your article and what the newspaper intends to print. I can assure you that they will be very different. The article that we're doing is mainly about the direction that bottles travel - you know, ocean currents and all that. We just want some actual letters that will provide some sort of human interest to our readers."</p>
<p>Where did that come from?</p>
<p>"Well..."</p>
<p>"Please, Mr. Shendakin. It would really mean a lot to me."</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>"Just a copy?"</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>"Yes, of course. I can give you a fax number, or you can send it. Should I make the check out to you?"</p>
<p>He paused again before answering. "I... I suppose so." He sounded as though he'd been somehow maneuvered into a corner and didn't know how to get out.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mr. Shendakin." Before he could change his mind, Theresa gave him the fax number, took his address, and made a note to pick up a money order the following day. She thought it might look suspicious if she sent one of her personal checks.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day, after calling the professor's office at Boston College to leave a message for him that the payment had been sent, she went to work. The possible existence of a third letter made it difficult to think of anything else. True, there still wasn't any guarantee that the letter was from the same person, but if it was, she didn't know what she would do. She'd thought about Garrett almost all night, trying to picture what he looked like, imagining things he liked to do. She didn't understand quite what she was feeling, but in the end, she decided to let the letter decide things. If it wasn't from Garrett, she would end all this now. But if the letter was from Garrett...</p>
<p>She went to the fax machine and began to look through the stack. It hadn't been sorted yet, and there were a few dozen pages addressed to various people. In the middle of the stack, she found a cover letter addressed to her. With it were two more pages, and when she looked more closely at them, the first thing she noticed - as she had with the other two letters - was the sailing ship stamped in the upper right-hand corner. But this one was shorter than the other letters, and she read it before she got back to her desk. The final paragraph was the one she had seen in Arthur Shendakin's article.</p>
<p>September 25, 1995</p>
<p>Dear Catherine,</p>
<p>A month has passed since I've written. Life passes by now like the scenery outside a car window. I breathe, and eat, and sleep as I always did, but there is no great purpose in my life that requires active participation on my part. I simply drift along like the messages I write you. I do not know where I am going or when I will get there.</p>
<p>Even work does not take the pain away. I may be diving for my own pleasure or showing others how to do so, but when I return to the shop, it seems empty without you. I stock and order as I always did, but even now, I sometimes glance over my shoulder without thinking and call for you. As I write this note to you, I wonder when, or if, things like that will ever stop.</p>
<p>Without you in my arms, I feel an emptiness in my soul. I find myself searching the crowds for your face - I know it is an impossibility, but I cannot help myself. My search for you is a never-ending quest that is hopeless. You and I had talked about what would happen if we were forced apart by circumstance, but I cannot keep the promise I made to you that night. I am sorry, my darling, but there will never be another to replace you. The words I whispered to you were folly, but I did not realize it then. You - and you alone - have always been the only thing I wanted, and now that you are gone, I have no desire to find another. Till death do us part, we whispered in the church, and I've come to believe that the words will ring true until the day finally comes when I, too, am taken from this world.</p>
<p>Garrett</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Deanna, do you have a minute? I need to talk to you."</p>
<p>Deanna looked up from her computer and took off her reading glasses. "Of course I do. What's up?"</p>
<p>Theresa laid the three letters on Deanna's desk without speaking. Deanna picked them up one by one, her eyes were widening in surprise.</p>
<p>"Where did you get these other two letters?"</p>
<p>Theresa explained how she'd come across them. When she finished her story, Deanna read the letters in silence. Theresa sat in the chair opposite her.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, putting down the last letter, "you've certainly been keeping a secret, haven't you?"</p>
<p>Theresa shrugged.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean," Deanna said with a sly smile, "you didn't come in here because you found the letters. You came in here because you're interested in this Garrett fellow."</p>
<p>Theresa's mouth opened, and Deanna laughed.</p>
<p>"Don't look so surprised, Theresa. I'm not a complete idiot. I knew something was going on these last few days. You've been so distracted around here - it's like you've been a hundred miles away. I was going to ask you about it, but I figured you'd talk to me when you were ready."</p>
<p>"I thought I was keeping things under control."</p>
<p>"Perhaps for other people. But I've known you long enough to know when something's wrong with you." She smiled again. "So tell me, what's going on?"</p>
<p>Theresa thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"It's been really strange. I mean, I can't stop thinking about him, and I don't know why. It's like I'm in high school again and I have a crush on someone I've never spoken with. Only this is worse - I've never even seen him. He could be a seventy-year-old man."</p>
<p>Deanna leaned back in her chair and nodded thoughtfully. "That's true... but you don't think that's the case, do you?"</p>
<p>Theresa slowly shook her head. "No, not really."</p>
<p>"Neither do I," Deanna said as she picked up the letters again. "He talks about how they fell in love when they were young, he hasn't mentioned any children, he teaches diving, and writes about Catherine as if he had only been married a few years. I doubt if he's that old."</p>
<p>"That's what I thought, too."</p>
<p>"Do you want to know what I think?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p>Deanna spoke the words carefully. "I think you should go to Wilmington to try to find Garrett."</p>
<p>"But it seems so... so ridiculous, even to me -"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I don't know anything about him."</p>
<p>"Theresa, you know a good deal more about Garrett than I did about Brian before I met him. Besides, I didn't tell you to marry him, I just told you to go find him. You may find out that you don't like him at all, but at least you'll know, won't you? I mean, what can it hurt?"</p>
<p>"What if..." She paused and Deanna finished her statement.</p>
<p>"What if he's not what you imagine? Theresa, I can guarantee he's not what you're imagining already. No one ever is. But to my mind, that shouldn't make any difference in your decision. If you think you want to find out more, just go. The worst thing that can happen is you find out he's not the kind of man you're looking for. And what would you do then? You'd come back to Boston, but you'd come back with your answer. How bad would that be? Probably no worse than what you're going through now."</p>
<p>"You don't think this whole thing is crazy?"</p>
<p>Deanna shook her head thoughtfully. "Theresa, I've wanted you to start looking for another man for a long time. As I told you when we were on vacation, you deserve to find another person to share your life with. Now, I don't know how this whole thing with Garrett will work out. It's probably not going to lead to anything. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. If everyone who thought they might fail didn't even try, where would we be today?"</p>
<p>Theresa was silent for a moment. "You're too logical about this whole thing..."</p>
<p>Deanna shrugged off her protests. "I'm older than you, and I've gone through a lot. One of the things I've learned in my life is that sometimes you've got to take a chance. And to me, this one isn't all that large. I mean, you're not leaving your husband and family to go find this person, and you're not giving up your job and moving across the country. You're really in a wonderful situation. If you feel like you should go, go. If you don't want to go, don't. It's really as simple as that. Besides, Kevin isn't around and you have plenty of vacation left this year."</p>
<p>"And my column?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. We still have the one column you wrote that we didn't use because we published the letter instead. After that, we can run a couple of repeats from past years. Most papers hadn't picked up your column then, so they probably won't know the difference."</p>
<p>"You make this sound so easy."</p>
<p>"It is easy. The hard part is to find him. But I think these letters have some information we can use to help you. What do you say we make a few phone calls and do a little hunting on the computer?"</p>
<p>They were both silent for a long time.</p>
<p>"Okay," Theresa said finally.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"So," Theresa asked Deanna, "where do we begin?"</p>
<p>She pulled her chair around to the other side of Deanna's desk.</p>
<p>"Let's begin with what we're pretty sure about. First, I think it's fair to say that his name actually is Garrett. That's how he signed all the letters."</p>
<p>"And," Theresa added, "he's probably in Wilmington or Wrightsville Beach, or another community close by."</p>
<p>Deanna nodded. "All his letters talk about the ocean or ocean themes, and of course, that's where he throws the bottles. From the tone of the letters, it sounds like he writes them when he gets lonely or when he's thinking about Catherine."</p>
<p>"That's what I thought. He didn't mention any special occasions in the letters. They talked about his day-to-day life, and what he was going through."</p>
<p>"Okay, good," Deanna said, nodding. She was getting more excited as they went on. "There was a boat that was mentioned..."</p>
<p>"Happenstance," Theresa said. "The letter said that they restored the boat and used to sail together. So, it's probably a sailboat."</p>
<p>"Write that down," Deanna said. "We may be able to find out more about that with a couple of calls from here. Maybe there's a place that registers boats by name. I think I can call the paper down there to find out. Was there anything else in the second letter?"</p>
<p>"Not that I can tell. But the third letter has a little bit more information. From what he writes, two things stand out."</p>
<p>"One, that Catherine has indeed passed away," Deanna said.</p>
<p>"And also that it looks like he owns a scuba-diving shop where he and Catherine used to work."</p>
<p>"That's another thing to write down. I think we can find out more about that from up here as well. Anything else?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so."</p>
<p>"Well, it's a good beginning. This might be easier than we think. Let's start making some calls."</p>
<p>The first place Deanna called was the Wilmington Journal, the newspaper that served the area. She identified herself and asked to speak with someone who was familiar with boating.</p>
<p>Soon she was speaking with Zack Norton, who covered sportfishing and other ocean sports. After explaining that she wanted to know if there was a place that kept a registry of boat names, she was told that there wasn't.</p>
<p>"Boats are registered with an identification number, almost like cars," he said, "but if you have the name of the person, you might be able to find out the name of the boat on the form if it's listed. It's not a required piece of information, but a lot of people put it down anyway."</p>
<p>After thanking Zack Norton for his time and hanging up, Deanna looked over the list of clues again. She thought for a moment, and then decided to call information for the phone numbers of scuba-diving shops in the Wilmington area. Theresa watched as Deanna wrote down the names and numbers of the eleven shops that were listed. "Is there anything else I can do for you, ma'am?" the operator asked.</p>
<p>"No, you've been more than helpful. Thank you."</p>
<p>She hung up the phone, and Theresa looked at her curiously. "What are you going to ask them when you call?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to ask for Garrett."</p>
<p>Theresa's heart skipped a beat. "Just like that?"</p>
<p>"Just like that," Deanna said, smiling as she dialed, and they both waited quietly for someone to answer at Atlantic Adventures, the first name they were given.</p>
<p>When the phone finally picked up, Deanna took a deep breath and asked pleasantly if Garrett was available to teach any classes. "I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong number," the voice said quickly. Deanna apologized and hung up.</p>
<p>They received the same answer on the next five calls. Deanna went down the list to the next name and dialed again. Expecting the same answer, she was surprised when the person on the line hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Are you talking about Garrett Blake?"</p>
<p>Garrett.</p>
<p>Deanna said yes, and the man who answered went on.</p>
<p>"He's with Island Diving. Are you sure we can't help you? We've got some classes starting soon."</p>
<p>Deanna quickly excused herself. "No, I'm sorry. I really need to work with Garrett. I promised him I would." When she put the phone back in the cradle, she was smiling broadly.</p>
<p>"So, we're getting close now."</p>
<p>"I can't believe it was that easy... Do you think it's the same Garrett?"</p>
<p>Deanne raised an eyebrow. "Don't you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know yet. Maybe."</p>
<p>Deanna shrugged off the reply. "Well, we'll find out soon enough. This is getting fun."</p>
<p>Deanna then called information again and got the number for the ship registry of Wilmington. After dialing, she told the voice on the line who she was and asked for someone who could help her verify some information. "My husband and I were vacationing down there," she told the woman who answered the phone, "when our boat broke down. This nice gentleman found us and helped us get back to shore. His name was Garrett Blake, and I think the name of his boat was Happenstance, but I want to be sure when I write the story."</p>
<p>Deanna went on quickly. She told the woman how scared she had been and how much it had meant when Garrett had come to their rescue. Then, after flattering the woman about how nice people were in the South and Wilmington in particular and how she wanted to do a story on southern hospitality and the kindness of strangers, the woman was more than willing to help. "Since you're just verifying the information and not asking for anything you don't know, I'm sure it won't be a problem. Hold on for a second."</p>
<p>The woman picked up again soon.</p>
<p>"Okay. Let's see now..." Deanna heard tapping on a keyboard, then a strange beep. After a moment, the woman said the words that both Deanna and Theresa hoped she would.</p>
<p>"Yes, here it is. Garrett Blake. Um... you got the name right, at least according to the information we have. It says here that the boat is named Happenstance."</p>
<p>Deanna thanked her and asked for the lady's name, "so she could write about another person who embodied hospitality." After spelling it back to the woman, she hung up the phone, beaming.</p>
<p>"Garrett Blake," she said with a victorious smile. "Our mysterious writer is named Garrett Blake."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you found him."</p>
<p>Deanna nodded as if she'd accomplished something even she doubted she could do. "Believe it. This old woman still knows how to research information."</p>
<p>"That you do."</p>
<p>"Anything else that you want to know more about?"</p>
<p>Theresa thought for a moment. "Can you find out anything about Catherine?"</p>
<p>Deanna shrugged and readied herself for the task. "I don't know, but we can give it a try. Let's call the paper to see if anything is in their records. If the death was accidental, maybe they mentioned it in the news."</p>
<p>Again, Deanna called the paper and asked for the news department. Unfortunately, after speaking with a couple of people, she was told that newspapers from a few years back were recorded on microfiche and couldn't be accessed easily without a specific date. Deanna asked for and received a name that Theresa should contact when she got down there, in case she wanted to look up the information on her own.</p>
<p>"I think that's about all we can do from here. The rest is up to you, Theresa. But at least you know where to find him."</p>
<p>Deanna held out the slip of paper with the name. Theresa hesitated. Deanna looked at her for a moment, and then set the paper on the desk. She picked up the phone one more time.</p>
<p>"Now who're you calling?"</p>
<p>"My travel agency. You're going to need a flight and a place to stay."</p>
<p>"I haven't even said I was going yet."</p>
<p>"Oh, you're going."</p>
<p>"How can you be so sure?"</p>
<p>"Because I'm not going to have you sitting around the newsroom for the next year wondering what might have been. You don't work well when you're distracted. You know the curiosity would drive you crazy. It's already driving me crazy."</p>
<p>"But... I don't even know what I would say if I finally met him..."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you'll think of something. Now, let me take care of this call. Go get your purse. I'm going to need a credit card number."</p>
<p>Theresa's mind was a whirl as she started back to her desk. Garrett Blake. Wilmington. Island Diving. Happenstance. The words kept rolling through her head, as if she were rehearsing for a part in a play.</p>
<p>She unlocked the bottom drawer where she kept her purse and paused for a second before going back. In the end, she handed Deanna a credit card. The following evening she would leave for Wilmington, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Deanna told her to take the rest of that day and the following off, and on her way out of the office, Theresa felt as if she had been cornered into something in the same way she had cornered old Mr. Shendakin.</p>
<p>But unlike Mr. Shendakin, deep down she was pleased about it, and when the plane touched down in Wilmington the following day, Theresa Osborne checked into a hotel, wondering where all this would lead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER FIVE</p>
<p>Theresa woke early and rose from the bed to look out the window. The North Carolina sun was casting golden prisms through an early morning haze, and she slid open the balcony door to freshen the room.</p>
<p>She thought about how easy it had been to get here. A little less than forty-eight hours ago she had been sitting with Deanna, studying the letters, making phone calls, and searching for Garrett. Once she got home, she had spoken to Ella, who again agreed to watch Harvey and pick up her mail.</p>
<p>The next day she went to the library and read up on scuba diving. It seemed like the logical thing to do. Her years as a reporter had taught her to make a plan, and to do her best to prepare for anything.</p>
<p>Her plan was simple. She would go to Island Diving and browse around the store, with the hope of getting a look at Garrett Blake. If he turned out to be a seventy-year-old man or a twenty-year-old student, she would simply turn around and go home. But if their instincts were right and he was approximately her age, she decided she would try to speak with him. That was why she had learned something about scuba diving - she wanted to sound as if she knew something about it. And she would probably be able to learn more about him if she could talk to him about something he was interested in.</p>
<p>But after that? That was the part she wasn't exactly sure about. She didn't want to tell Garrett the complete truth about why she came - that would sound crazy. Hi, I read your letters to Catherine, and knowing how much you loved her, I just thought you might be the man I've been looking for. No, that was out of the question.</p>
<p>She took a shower and dressed in a short-sleeved white blouse, denim shorts, and a pair of white sandals. She wanted to look casual, and she did. When she was ready to leave, she found the phone book, thumbed through it, and scribbled the address of Island Diving on a piece of paper. Two deep breaths later, she was walking down the hall.</p>
<p>Her first stop was at a store, where she bought a map of Wilmington. The clerk had also given her directions, and she found her way easily, despite the fact that Wilmington was larger than she had imagined. The streets were packed with cars, especially as she passed by the bridges that led to the islands right off the coast. Kure Beach, Carolina Beach, and Wrightsville Beach were reached by bridges that crossed from the city, and that was where most of the traffic was headed.</p>
<p>Island Diving was located near the marina. It was an old wooden building, faded from the salt air and sea breezes, with one side of the store facing the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. The hand-painted sign hung on two rusty metal chains, and the windows had the dusty look of a thousand rainstorms.</p>
<p>She paused before opening the door to take a deep breath and collect her thoughts, then stepped inside, doing her best to pretend she was there for ordinary reasons.</p>
<p>She browsed through the store, walking among the aisles, watching customers pull and replace items from the racks. She glanced at every man in the store, wondering, Are you Garrett? Most, however, were customers.</p>
<p>She worked her way to the back wall and found herself staring at a series of newspaper and magazine articles, framed and laminated, hanging above the racks. After a quick glance, she leaned forward for a closer look and suddenly realized she had stumbled across the answer to the first question she had about the mysterious Garrett Blake.</p>
<p>She finally knew what he looked like.</p>
<p>The first article, reprinted from the newspaper, was about scuba diving, and the caption beneath the photo read simply "Garrett Blake of Island Diving, readying his class for its first ocean dive."</p>
<p>He was in his thirties, with a lean face and short brown hair. The sleeveless shirt he was wearing showed well-defined muscles in his arms. She couldn't make out the color of his eyes, though she could tell that his face was weathered as well. She saw wrinkles around the corners of his eyes. She read the article carefully, noting when he generally taught his classes and some facts about getting certification.</p>
<p>The second article had no picture but talked about shipwreck diving, which was popular in North Carolina. The third article concerned the Monitor, the first federal ironclad of the Civil War. En route to South Carolina, it had sunk off Cape Hatteras in 1862. The wreck had finally been discovered, and Garrett Blake, along with other divers from Duke Marine Institute, had been asked to dive to the ocean floor to explore the possibility of raising it.</p>
<p>The fourth article was about Happenstance. Eight pictures of the boat had been taken from various angles, inside and out, all detailing the restoration. The boat, she learned, was unique - it was made entirely of wood and had been manufactured in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1927. It had a long and adventurous history. By the time Garrett Blake purchased it four years ago, it had fallen into disrepair, and the article said that he and his wife, Catherine, had restored it.</p>
<p>Catherine...</p>
<p>Theresa looked at the article's date. April 1992. The article didn't mention that Catherine had died, and because one of the letters she had was found three years ago in Norfolk, it meant that Catherine probably died sometime in 1993.</p>
<p>"Can I help you?"</p>
<p>Theresa turned instinctively toward the voice. A young man was smiling behind her, and she was suddenly glad she had seen a picture of Garrett moments before. This person obviously wasn't he.</p>
<p>"Did I startle you?" he asked, and Theresa quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>"No... I was just looking at the pictures."</p>
<p>He nodded toward them. "She's something, isn't she?"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Happenstance. Garrett - the guy that owns the shop - rebuilt her. She's a wonderful boat."</p>
<p>"Is he here? Garrett, I mean."</p>
<p>"No, he's down at the docks. He won't be in until later this morning."</p>
<p>"Oh..."</p>
<p>"Can I help you find something? Everything you need to go diving you can find here."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "No, I was just browsing, actually."</p>
<p>"Okay, but if I can help you find something, let me know"</p>
<p>"I will," she said, and the young man nodded cheerfully, then turned and started toward the counter at the front of the store. Before she could stop the words, she heard herself ask:</p>
<p>"You said Garrett was at the docks?"</p>
<p>He turned again and kept walking backward as he spoke. "Yeah - a couple blocks down the road. At the marina. Do you know where that is?"</p>
<p>"I think I passed it on the way here."</p>
<p>"He should be there for the next hour or so, but like I said, if you come back later, he'll be here. Do you want me to leave a message for him?"</p>
<p>"No, that's okay. It's not that important."</p>
<p>She spent the next three minutes pretending to look at different items on the racks, and then walked out after waving good-bye to the young man.</p>
<p>She headed in the direction of the marina.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When she reached the marina, she looked around, looking for Happenstance. Because the majority of boats were white and Happenstance was natural wood, she found it easily and made her way to the appropriate ramp.</p>
<p>As she approached the boat, the first thing she noticed was that no one was around. The boat was locked down, the sail covered, and nothing seemed out of place. After looking around for any sign of him, she checked the name on the back of the boat. It was indeed Happenstance. Odd, she thought, the man at the store had said he was here.</p>
<p>Instead of returning to the shop right away, she took a moment to admire the boat. It was beautiful. It had much more character than the other sailboats docked on either side of it, and she knew why the paper had done an article on it. In a way, it reminded her of a much smaller version of pirate ships she had seen in the movies.</p>
<p>She finally decided to try Island Diving a little later. It was obvious the man at the store was mistaken. After one last glance at the boat, she turned to leave.</p>
<p>A man stood on the ramp a few feet from her, watching her carefully.</p>
<p>Garrett...</p>
<p>He was sweating in the morning heat, and his shirt was soaked through in a couple of places. The sleeves had been torn off, revealing tight muscles in his arms and forearms. His hands were black with grease, and the diver's watch he had on his wrist looked scarred, as if he'd used it for years. He looked like someone who spent most, if not all, of his time near the ocean.</p>
<p>He watched her as she took an involuntary step backward.</p>
<p>"Can I help you with something?" he asked, smiling.</p>
<p>Their eyes met. For a moment, all she could do was stare at him. Despite the fact that she had seen a picture of him, he looked better than she expected, though she wasn't sure why. He was tall and broad-shouldered. His eyes weren't nearly as hypnotic as David's had been, but there was something compelling about him for sure. Something masculine in the way he stood before her.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and motioned toward Happenstance.</p>
<p>"I was just admiring your boat. It's really beautiful."</p>
<p>Rubbing his hands together to remove some of the excess grease, he said politely, "Thank you, that's nice of you to say."</p>
<p>His steady gaze exposed the reality of the situation, and suddenly everything came to her at once - finding the bottle, her growing curiosity, the research she had done, her trip to Wilmington, and finally this meeting, face-to-face.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed, she closed her eyes. Somehow, she hadn't expected this to happen so quickly. She suddenly felt a moment of pure terror.</p>
<p>He took a small step forward. "Are you okay?" he asked in a concerned voice.</p>
<p>Taking another deep breath and willing herself to relax, she said, "Yeah, I think so. I just got a little dizzy there for a second."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>She ran her hand through her hair, embarrassed. "Yeah. I'm fine now. Really."</p>
<p>"Good," he said as if waiting to see whether she was telling the truth. Then, after he was sure she was, he asked curiously, "Have we met before?"</p>
<p>Theresa shook her head slowly. "I don't think so."</p>
<p>"Then how did you know the boat was mine?"</p>
<p>Relieved, she answered, "Oh... I saw your picture down at the shop in the articles on the wall, along with the pictures of the boat. The young man in your shop said you would be here, and I thought that as long as you were, I'd come down to see for myself."</p>
<p>"He said I was here?"</p>
<p>She was silent as she remembered the exact words. "Actually, he told me you were at the docks. I just assumed that meant you were here."</p>
<p>He nodded. "I was at the other boat - the one we use for diving."</p>
<p>A small fishing boat blared its horn, and Garrett turned and waved to the man standing on the deck. After it had gone by, he faced her again and was struck by how pretty she was.</p>
<p>"You did a wonderful job restoring it," Theresa said.</p>
<p>He smiled faintly. "Thanks, that's kind of you to say."</p>
<p>Theresa glanced toward Happenstance as he spoke, then back to him. "I know it's not any of my business," she said casually, "but since you're here, would you mind if I asked you a little bit about it?"</p>
<p>"What would you like to know?"</p>
<p>She did her best to sound conversational. "Well, was her condition as bad when you first got her as the article implied?"</p>
<p>"Actually, it was in worse condition." He stepped forward and pointed to the various spots on the boat as he mentioned them. "A lot of the wood had rotted near the bow, there were a series of leaks along the side - it was a wonder she was still afloat at all. We had to replace a good portion of the hull and the deck, and that was just the outside. We had to do the inside, too, and that took a great deal longer."</p>
<p>Though she noticed the word "we" in his answer, she decided not to comment on it.</p>
<p>"It was a lot of work."</p>
<p>She smiled as she said it, and Garrett felt something tighten inside. Damn, she's pretty.</p>
<p>"It was, but it was worth it. She's more fun to sail than other boats."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because she was built by people who used her to make their living'. They put a lot of care into designing her, and that makes sailing a lot easier."</p>
<p>"I take it you've been sailing a long time."</p>
<p>"Ever since I was a kid."</p>
<p>She nodded. After a short pause, she took a small step toward the boat. "Do you mind?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "No, go ahead."</p>
<p>Theresa stepped toward it and ran her hands along the side of the hull. Garrett noticed that she wasn't wearing a ring, though it shouldn't matter one way or the other. Without turning, Theresa asked, "What kind of wood is this?"</p>
<p>"Mahogany."</p>
<p>"The whole boat?"</p>
<p>"Most of it. Except for the masts and some of the interior."</p>
<p>She nodded again, and Garrett watched as she walked alongside Happenstance. As she stepped farther away, he noticed her figure and her straight, dark hair. But it wasn't only the way she looked that caught his eye - there was a confidence in the way she moved. It was as if she knew exactly what men were thinking as she stood near them, he realized suddenly. He shook his head.</p>
<p>"How long did it take you to restore it?" she asked, turning to face him.</p>
<p>"Almost a year."</p>
<p>She peeked in one of the round windows, but it was too dark to make out much of the interior. "What did you sail on while you were fixing Happenstance?"</p>
<p>"We didn't. There wasn't enough time, not with working in the shop, teaching classes, and trying to get this one ready."</p>
<p>Again, she heard the word "we."</p>
<p>After admiring the boat for another few seconds, she returned to his side. For a moment, neither of them spoke.</p>
<p>"Well," she finally said as she crossed her arms, "I've probably taken enough of your time."</p>
<p>"It's okay," he said. "I love to talk about sailing."</p>
<p>"I would, too. It always looked like fun to me."</p>
<p>"You sound like you've never gone sailing before."</p>
<p>She shrugged. "I haven't. I've always wanted to go, but I've never actually had the chance."</p>
<p>"Well, if you'd like to go, I usually take her out after work. You're welcome to come along this evening."</p>
<p>Why he'd said that, he wasn't exactly sure. Maybe, he thought, it was a desire for female companionship after all these years, if only for a short time. Or maybe it had something to do with the way her eyes lit up whenever she talked. But, anyway, he had just asked her to come with him, and there was nothing he could do to change it.</p>
<p>Theresa, too, was a little surprised, but she quickly decided to accept. It was, after all, the reason she'd come to Wilmington.</p>
<p>"I'd love to," she said. "What time?"</p>
<p>"How about seven o'clock? The sun begins to drop then, and it's the ideal time to go out."</p>
<p>"Seven o'clock is great for me. I'll bring along something to eat." To Garrett's surprise, she looked both pleased and excited about going.</p>
<p>"You don't have to do that."</p>
<p>"I know, but it's the least I can do. After all, you didn't have to offer to bring me along. Are sandwiches okay?"</p>
<p>Garrett took a small step backward, suddenly needing a little breathing space. "Yeah, that's fine. I'm not that picky."</p>
<p>"Okay," she said, then paused for a moment. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, waiting to see if he'd say anything else. When he didn't, she absently adjusted the purse on her shoulder. "I guess I'll see you tonight. Here at the boat, right?"</p>
<p>"Right here," he said, and realized how tense he sounded. He cleared his throat and smiled a little. "It will be fun. You'll enjoy it."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I will. See you later."</p>
<p>She turned and started down the docks; her hair was blowing in the breeze. As she was walking away, Garrett realized what he'd forgotten.</p>
<p>"Hey!" he shouted.</p>
<p>She stopped and turned to face him, using her hand to shield her eyes from the sun. "Yes?"</p>
<p>He took a couple of steps in her direction. "I forgot to ask. What's your name?"</p>
<p>"I'm Theresa. Theresa Osborne."</p>
<p>"My name's Garrett Blake."</p>
<p>"Okay, Garrett, I'll see you at seven."</p>
<p>With that, she turned and walked briskly away. Garrett watched her retreating figure, trying to make sense of his conflicting emotions. Though part of him was excited about what had just happened, another part of him felt that there was something wrong with the whole thing. He knew there wasn't any reason to feel guilty, but the feeling was definitely there, and he wished there was something he could do about it.</p>
<p>But there wasn't, of course. There never was.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER SIX</p>
<p>The clock rolled past the dinner hour and onward toward seven, but for Garrett Blake, time had stopped three years ago when Catherine had stepped off the curb and was killed by an elderly man who lost control of his car and changed the lives of two separate families forever. In the following weeks, his anger at the driver eventually gave way to plans of revenge that went unfulfilled, simply because his sorrow made him incapable of any action. He couldn't sleep more than three hours a night, cried whenever he saw her clothes in the closet, and lost almost twenty pounds on a diet that consisted of coffee and crackers. The following month, he started smoking for the first time in his life and turned to alcohol on nights when the pain was too unbearable. His father temporarily took over the business while Garrett sat in silence on the back porch of his home, trying to imagine a world without her. He had neither the will nor the desire to exist anymore, and sometimes as he sat there, he hoped that the salty, humid air would swallow him up completely so he wouldn't have to face the future alone.</p>
<p>What made it so hard was that it seemed as though he couldn't remember a time when she wasn't around. They had known each other most of their lives and had attended the same schools throughout their younger years. In third grade they were best friends, and he gave her two cards on Valentine's Day, but after that, they drifted apart and simply coexisted as they progressed from one grade to the next. Catherine was always the smallest in her class, and though Garrett always held a special place in his heart for her, he never noticed that she was slowly becoming an attractive young woman. They never went to a movie, but after four years at Chapel Hill, where he majored in marine biology, he bumped into her at Wrightsville Beach and suddenly realized how foolish he had been. She was no longer the awkward girl he remembered. In a word, she was beautiful, with wonderful curves that made men and women alike turn their heads whenever she walked past them. Her hair was blond and her eyes held infinite mystery; and when he finally closed his gaping mouth and asked her what she was doing later, they started a relationship that eventually led to marriage and six wonderful years together.</p>
<p>On their wedding night, alone in a hotel room lit only by candles, she handed him the two valentines he'd once given her and laughed aloud when she saw the expression on his face when he realized what they were. "Of course I kept them," she whispered as she wrapped her arms around him.</p>
<p>"It was the first time I ever loved someone. Love is love, no matter how old you are, and I knew that if I gave you enough time, you'd come back to me."</p>
<p>Whenever Garrett found himself thinking of her, he remembered either the way she looked that night or the way she looked the very last time they went sailing.</p>
<p>Garrett exhaled sharply, dispelling the memory like smoke. Though he could remember the events of that evening, he found that as time was rolling on, it was becoming more and more difficult to visualize exactly the way she looked. Little by little, her features were beginning to vanish before his eyes, and though he knew that forgetting helped to reduce the pain, what he wanted most of all was to see her again. In three years, he'd looked through the photo album only once, and that had hurt so much he'd sworn it was the last time he'd ever do it. Now he saw her clearly only at night, after he'd fallen asleep. He loved it when he dreamed of her because it seemed as though she were still alive. She talked and moved, he held her in his arms, and for a moment, it seemed that everything was suddenly right in the world. But upon waking, he always felt exhausted and depressed.</p>
<p>His father tried to help as best he could. He, too, had lost a wife and so knew what his son was going through. Garrett still visited him at least once a week and always enjoyed the company his father provided. He was the one person Garrett shared a real understanding with. Last year his father had told him that he should start dating again. "It isn't right that you're always alone," he'd said. "It's almost like you've given up." Garrett knew there was a measure of truth to that. But the simple fact was that he had no desire to find anyone else. He hadn't made love to a woman since Catherine had died, and worse, he'd felt no desire for that, either. When Garrett asked his father why he should take the advice when he himself had never remarried, his father simply looked away.</p>
<p>But then his father said something else that haunted them both, something he later wished he hadn't said at all.</p>
<p>"Do you really think it's possible for me to find someone else who's good enough to take her place?"</p>
<p>In time, Garrett returned to the shop and started working again, doing his best to go on with his life. He stayed at the shop as late as he could, organizing files and rearranging his office, simply because it was less painful than going home. He found that if it was dark enough outside by the time he got back to his house and he turned on only a few lights, he didn't notice her things as much and her presence wasn't as strong. He got used to living alone again, cooking, cleaning, and doing his own laundry, and he even worked in the garden as she used to, though he didn't enjoy it as much as she did.</p>
<p>He thought he was getting better, but when the time came to pack up Catherine's things, he didn't have the heart to do it. His father eventually took matters into his own hands. After a weekend spent diving, Garrett came home to a house without her belongings. Then the house was empty; he no longer saw any reason to stay. He sold it within a month, moved to a smaller house on Carolina Beach, thinking that by leaving, he would finally be able to move on. And he had, kind of, for over three years now.</p>
<p>His father hadn't found everything, though. In a small box that sat in his end table, he kept a few things that he couldn't part with - the valentine cards he'd once given her, her wedding ring, and other things that people wouldn't understand. Late at night, he liked to hold them in his hands, and even though his father sometimes commented that it seemed he was doing better, he lay there thinking that no, he wasn't. To him, nothing would ever be the same again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Garrett Blake went to the marina to get Happenstance ready. He removed the sail cover, unlocked the cabin, and generally checked everything out.</p>
<p>His father had called just as he was stepping out the door on the way to the docks, and now Garrett remembered the conversation.</p>
<p>"Would you like to come for supper?" he had asked.</p>
<p>Garrett had replied that he couldn't. "I'm going sailing with someone tonight."</p>
<p>His father had stayed quiet for a moment. Then: "With a woman?"</p>
<p>Garrett explained briefly how he and Theresa met.</p>
<p>"You sound like you're a little nervous about your date," his father remarked.</p>
<p>"No, Dad, I'm not nervous. And it's not a date. As I said, we're just going sailing. She said she'd never gone before."</p>
<p>"Is she pretty?"</p>
<p>"What does that matter?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't. But it still sounds like a date to me."</p>
<p>"It's not a date."</p>
<p>"If you say so."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Garrett saw her walking up the dock a little after seven, dressed in shorts and a red sleeveless shirt, carrying a small picnic basket in one hand and a sweatshirt and light jacket in the other. She didn't look as nervous as he felt. When she waved, he felt some familiar pangs of guilt and quickly waved back before he finished untying the lines. He was mumbling to himself and doing his best to clear his mind when she reached the boat.</p>
<p>"Hi," she said easily. "I hope you haven't been waiting long."</p>
<p>He took off the gloves he was wearing as he spoke. "Oh, hi. And no - I haven't been waiting long at all. I came out here a little early to get her ready."</p>
<p>"Did you finish everything you needed?"</p>
<p>He glanced around to make sure. "Yeah, I think so. Can I help you up?"</p>
<p>He set aside the gloves and extended his arm. Theresa handed him her things, and he set them on one of the seats that ran along the deck. Then he took her hands to pull her up. After she was safely aboard, he motioned toward the wheel, taking a small step backward.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to head out?"</p>
<p>"Whenever you are."</p>
<p>"Then go ahead and take a seat. I'm going to get us out onto the water. Do you want anything to drink before we get going? I have some soda in the refrigerator."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "No thanks. I'm fine right now."</p>
<p>She looked around the boat before finding a seat in the corner. She watched as he turned a key and the sound of an engine hummed to life. Then, stepping away from the wheel, he released the two lines that held the boat in place. Slowly Happenstance began to back out of its slip. A little surprised, Theresa said, "I didn't know there was an engine."</p>
<p>He turned and answered over his shoulder, speaking loudly enough so that she could hear him. "It's a small one - just enough power to get us in and out of the slip. We put a new one in when we rebuilt her."</p>
<p>When Happenstance was safely in the open water of the Intracoastal Waterway, Garrett turned into the wind, cut the engine and raised the sails.</p>
<p>He looked over his shoulder again. Catherine used to sit in the same spot, and with the setting sun splitting the shadows, there was a brief moment when he thought it was her. He pushed the thought away and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"Now we're on the Intracoastal, and we have to do our best to set a course out of the way of the other boats."</p>
<p>He held the wheel almost perfectly still, and Theresa felt Happenstance gradually picking up speed. She got up from her seat and started back toward Garrett, stopping when she reached his side.</p>
<p>Because she knew he was concentrating on what he was doing, she kept quiet as she stood next to him. From the corner of her eye, she watched him-his strong hands on the wheel, his long legs shifting his weight as the boat heeled in the wind.</p>
<p>She thought again that he wasn't the most handsome man she'd ever seen, but there was something arresting about him.</p>
<p>Earlier, when she'd spoken with Deanna on the phone, she'd tried to describe him, but because he didn't look like most of the men she knew in Boston, she'd had a hard time. She'd told Deanna that he was about her age, handsome in his own way and fit, but that he looked natural, as if his strength were simply the result of the life he'd chosen to live.</p>
<p>Deanna was thrilled when Theresa told her about going sailing later that evening, though Theresa had gone through a period of doubt immediately afterward. For a while, she worried about being alone with a stranger - especially out in the open water - but she convinced herself that her worries were unfounded. It's just like any other date, she'd told herself most of the afternoon. Don't make a big deal out of this. When it was time for her to head to the docks, however, she almost didn't. In the end, she'd decided it was something she had to do.</p>
<p>Once there was enough distance between Happenstance and the other boats, Garrett asked Theresa to hold the wheel. "Just keep it steady," he said. He adjusted the sails. Then he fixed the wheel so he didn't have to hold it.</p>
<p>"Okay, that should do it," he said, tapping the wheel, making sure it would stay in position. "We can take a seat if you want."</p>
<p>Garrett led the way back to where Theresa had been sitting earlier. They sat in the corner - she on the side, he against the back - angled so that they could face each other. Feeling the wind in her face, Theresa pulled her hair back, looking out over the water.</p>
<p>Garrett watched her as she did it. She was shorter than he was - about five feet seven, he guessed - with a lovely face and a figure that reminded him of models he had seen in magazines. But though she was attractive, there was something else about her that caught his eye. She was intelligent, he could sense that right away, and confident, too, as if she were able to move through life on her own terms. To him, these things really mattered. Without them, beauty was nothing.</p>
<p>In a way, when he looked at her, he was reminded of Catherine. Especially her expression. She looked as though she were daydreaming as she watched the water, and he felt his thoughts wandering back to the last time they had sailed together. Again, he felt guilty, though he did his best to push aside the feelings.</p>
<p>"It's really beautiful out here," she finally said as she turned toward him. "Thanks for inviting me along."</p>
<p>He was glad when she broke the silence.</p>
<p>"You're welcome. It's nice to have some company once in a while."</p>
<p>"Do you usually sail alone?"</p>
<p>He leaned back as he spoke, stretching his legs out in front of him. "Usually. It's a good way to relax after work. No matter how stressful the day is, once I get out here, the wind seems to blow it all away."</p>
<p>"Is diving that hard?"</p>
<p>"No, it's not the diving. That's the fun part. It's more or less everything else. The paperwork, dealing with people who cancel their lessons at the last minute, making sure the shop has the right amount of everything."</p>
<p>"But you like it, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I do. I wouldn't trade what I do for anything." He paused and adjusted the watch on his wrist. "So, Theresa, what do you do?" It was one of the few safe questions he'd thought up during the course of the day.</p>
<p>"I'm a columnist for the Boston Times."</p>
<p>"Here on vacation?"</p>
<p>She paused only slightly before answering. "You could say that."</p>
<p>He nodded, expecting the answer. "What do you write about?"</p>
<p>She smiled. "I write about parenting."</p>
<p>She saw the surprised look in his eyes, the same look she saw whenever she dated someone new. You may as well get this over with right away, she thought to herself. "I have a son," she went on. "He's twelve."</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. "Twelve?"</p>
<p>"You look shocked."</p>
<p>"I am. You don't look old enough to have a twelve-year-old."</p>
<p>"I'll take that as a compliment," she said. "But, yes, he is twelve. Would you like to see a picture?"</p>
<p>"Sure," he said.</p>
<p>She found her wallet, took out the photo, and handed it to him. Garrett stared at it for a moment, and then glanced at her.</p>
<p>"He has your complexion," he said, handing the picture back. "He's a good-looking boy."</p>
<p>"Thank you." As she was putting the picture away, she asked, "How about you? Do you have any children?"</p>
<p>"No." He shook his head. "No kids. At least none that I know of."</p>
<p>She chuckled at his answer, and he went on: "What's your son's name?"</p>
<p>"Kevin."</p>
<p>"Is he here in town with you?"</p>
<p>"No, he's with his father in California. We divorced a few years ago."</p>
<p>Garrett nodded without judgment, and then looked over his shoulder at another sailboat passing in the distance. Theresa watched it for a moment as well, and in the silence, she noticed how peaceful it was on the ocean compared to the Intracoastal. The only sounds now came from the sail as the wind rippled through it and the water as Happenstance cut its way through the waves.</p>
<p>"Would you like to see the rest of the boat?" Garrett asked.</p>
<p>She nodded. "I'd love to."</p>
<p>Garrett rose and checked the sails again before leading the way inside, Theresa was one step behind him. He opened the door and paused.</p>
<p>Theresa moved around him silently.</p>
<p>On Theresa's left, a seat ran along one side of the boat - wide and long enough for someone to sleep comfortably; directly opposite the seat on the other side was a small table with room enough for two people to sit. Near the door were a sink and stove burner with a small refrigerator underneath, and straight ahead was a door that led to the sleeping cabin.</p>
<p>He stood off to one side with his hands on his hips as she explored the interior, looking at everything. She could feel his eyes watching her, though he wasn't obvious about it. After a moment she said, "From the outside, you wouldn't think it's as large as it is."</p>
<p>"I know." Garrett cleared his throat awkwardly. "Surprising, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, it is. It looks like it has everything you need, though."</p>
<p>"It does."</p>
<p>He stepped around her and went to the refrigerator, bending over to pull a can of Coca-Cola from the refrigerator. "Would you like something to drink now?"</p>
<p>"Sure," she said. She ran her hands along the walls, feeling the texture of the wood.</p>
<p>"What would you like? I've got 7-Up or Coke."</p>
<p>"7-Up's fine," she answered.</p>
<p>He stood and handed her the can. Their fingers touched briefly, as she took it.</p>
<p>"I don't have any ice on board, but it's cold."</p>
<p>"I'll try to rough it," she said, and he smiled.</p>
<p>She opened it and took a swallow before setting it on the table.</p>
<p>As he opened his own can of soda, he looked at her, thinking about what she'd said earlier. She had a twelve-year-old son and she was a columnist... That meant she probably went to college. If she'd waited until after then to get married and have a child... that would make her about four or five years older than he was. She didn't look that much older but there was a maturity to her actions, something that came only to those who had experienced difficulties in life.</p>
<p>She turned her attention to a framed photograph that hung on the wall. In it, Garrett Blake was standing on a pier with a marlin he'd caught, looking much younger than he was now. In the photo, he was smiling broadly.</p>
<p>She said, "I see you like to fish." She pointed toward the picture. He stepped toward her, and once he was close, she felt the warmth radiating from him. He smelled like salt and wind.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I do," he said quietly. "My father was a shrimper, and I grew up on the water."</p>
<p>"How long ago was this taken?"</p>
<p>"That one's about ten years old - it was taken right before I went back to college for my senior year. There was a fishing contest, and my dad and I decided to spend a couple of nights out in the Gulf Stream and we caught that marlin about sixty miles off shore. It took almost seven hours to bring him in because my dad wanted me to learn how to do it the old-fashioned way."</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>He laughed under his breath. "Basically it means that my hands were cut to pieces by the time I was finished, and I could barely move my shoulders the next day. The line we had hooked it on wasn't really strong enough for a fish that size, so we had to let the marlin run until it stopped, then slowly reel it in, then let it run again all day long until the thing was too exhausted to fight anymore."</p>
<p>She looked at the picture again. "Is that your father standing next to you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's him."</p>
<p>"He looks like you," she said.</p>
<p>Garrett smiled a little. He motioned to the table, and Theresa sat down opposite him. Once she was comfortable, she asked:</p>
<p>"You said you went to college?"</p>
<p>He met her eyes. "Yeah, I went to UNC and majored in marine biology. Nothing else interested me much, and since my dad told me I couldn't come home without a degree, I thought I'd learn something that I might be able to use later."</p>
<p>"So you bought the shop..."</p>
<p>He shook his head. "No, at least not right away. After graduating, I worked as a dive specialist, but there wasn't much money in that. So, I got a teaching certificate and started taking in students on the weekends. The shop came a few years later." He paused. "How about you?"</p>
<p>Theresa took another drink of the 7-Up before she answered.</p>
<p>"My life isn't quite as exciting as yours. I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, and went to school at Brown. After graduation, I tried a few different things, eventually settling down in Boston. I've been with the Times for nine years now, but only the last few as a columnist. Before that, I was a reporter."</p>
<p>"How do you like being a columnist?"</p>
<p>She thought about it for a moment.</p>
<p>"It's a good job," she finally said. "A lot better now than when I started. I can pick Kevin up after school, and I have the freedom to write whatever I want, as long as it's in line with my column. It pays fairly well, too, so I can't complain about that, but..."</p>
<p>She paused again. "It's not all that challenging anymore. Don't get me wrong, I like what I do, but sometimes I feel like I'm writing the same things over and over. Even that wouldn't be so bad, though, if I didn't have so many other things to do with Kevin. I guess that right now, I'm your typical, overworked single mother, if you know what I mean."</p>
<p>He nodded and spoke softly. "Life doesn't often turn out the way we think it will, does it?"</p>
<p>"No, I guess it doesn't," Theresa said. She smiled and leaned toward him.</p>
<p>"Are you ready for something to eat? I brought some things in the basket."</p>
<p>"Whenever you are."</p>
<p>"I hope you like sandwiches and cold salads."</p>
<p>"It sounds fine. Would you like to eat down here or outside?"</p>
<p>"Outside, definitely."</p>
<p>They picked up their cans of soda and left the cabin. On their way out, Garrett grabbed a raincoat from a peg near the door and motioned for her to go on without him. "Give me a minute to drop the anchor," he said. Theresa reached her seat and opened the basket she had brought with her. On the horizon, the sun was sinking into clouds. She pulled out a couple of sandwiches wrapped in cellophane, as well as some containers of salad.</p>
<p>She watched as Garrett lowered the sails. The boat slowed almost immediately. With his back to her as he worked, she again noticed how strong he looked. From where she was sitting, his shoulder muscles appeared larger than she had first realized. She couldn't believe she was actually sailing with this man when only two days ago she was in Boston. The whole thing seemed unreal.</p>
<p>While Garrett worked steadily, Theresa looked upward. The breeze had picked up now that the temperature had dropped, and the sky was darkening slowly.</p>
<p>Once the boat had stopped completely, Garrett lowered the anchor and took his seat next to Theresa.</p>
<p>"I wish there was something I could do to help you," Theresa said with a smile. She flipped her hair onto her shoulder the same way Catherine used to, and for a moment, he didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Is everything okay?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>He nodded, suddenly uncomfortable again.</p>
<p>She put some potato salad and coleslaw along with his sandwich on his plate and handed it to him. Garrett reached for one of the white plastic forks and took a bite of coleslaw. Suddenly he stopped eating. He remembered one of his evenings on the boat together with Catherine.</p>
<p>"Garrett?"</p>
<p>Startled, Garrett looked at Theresa.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he began.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" She was staring at him with a mixture of concern and puzzlement.</p>
<p>"I'm fine... I was just remembering something I have to take care of," Garrett improvised. "Anyway," he said. "Enough about me. If you don't mind, Theresa... tell me something about yourself."</p>
<p>Puzzled and a little unsure about what he wanted to know exactly, she started from the beginning, touching on all the basic facts in a little more detail - her upbringing, her job, and her hobbies. Mostly, though, she talked about Kevin and what a wonderful son he was.</p>
<p>Garrett listened as she spoke, not saying much. When she finished he asked. "And you said you were married once?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "For eight years. But David - that's his name - had an affair I just couldn't live with that."</p>
<p>"I couldn't, either," Garrett said softly, "but it still doesn't make it any easier."</p>
<p>"No." She paused and took a drink of her soda. "But we're on friendly terms, in spite of everything. He's a good father to Kevin, and that's all I want from him now."</p>
<p>Theresa paused and then said, "Okay, your turn. Tell me about you."</p>
<p>Garrett also started from the beginning, talking about growing up in Wilmington as an only child. He told her that his mother had died when he was twelve, and because his father spent most of his time on the boat, he grew up on the water. He spoke about his college days and described what it had been like to start the shop and what his typical days were like now. Strangely, he said nothing at all about Catherine.</p>
<p>As they talked on, the sky turned to black and fog began to settle in around them. With the boat rocking slightly in the waves, a kind of intimacy descended upon them. The fresh air, the breeze in their faces, and the gentle movement of the boat eased their earlier nervousness.</p>
<p>When they reached a quiet point in the conversation, Garrett leaned back and ran his hands through his hair. He closed his eyes. Theresa quietly put the used plates and napkins back into the basket to keep them from blowing into the ocean. When Garrett was ready, he rose from his seat.</p>
<p>"I think it's about time we start back," he said, almost as if regretting that the trip was coming to an end.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the boat was under way again, and she noticed that the wind was much stronger than it had been earlier. Garrett stood at the wheel, keeping Happenstance on course. Theresa stood next to him with her hand on the railing, running through their conversation again and again in her head. Neither of them spoke for a long while, and Garrett Blake remembered another episode.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>On their last sail together, Catherine and Garrett talked quietly for hours, enjoying the wine and dinner.</p>
<p>Later that night, after making love, Catherine lay by Garrett's side, skimming her fingers across his chest, saying nothing.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking?" he asked finally.</p>
<p>"Just that I didn't think it was possible to love someone as much as I love you," she whispered.</p>
<p>Garrett ran his finger down her cheek. Catherine's eyes never left his.</p>
<p>"I didn't think it was possible, either," he answered softly. "I don't know what I'd ever do without you."</p>
<p>"Will you make me a promise?"</p>
<p>"Anything."</p>
<p>"If anything ever happens to me, promise me that you'll find someone else."</p>
<p>"I don't think I could love anyone except you."</p>
<p>"Just promise me, okay?"</p>
<p>It took a moment to answer. "All right - if it makes you happy, I promise."</p>
<p>He smiled tenderly.</p>
<p>Catherine smiled. "I'm happy, Garrett."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The lights from the buildings along the shore seemed to flicker in the slowly thickening fog. Happenstance rocked slightly in the rising waves as it approached the inlet, and Theresa looked over her shoulder for the things she had brought with her. Her jacket had blown into the corner near the cabin. She made a note not to forget it when she got back to the marina.</p>
<p>Even though Garrett had said he usually sailed alone, she wondered if he had brought anyone out besides Catherine and herself. And if he never had, what did that mean? She knew he had watched her carefully this evening, though he'd never been obvious. But even if he was curious about her, he'd kept his feelings well hidden. He hadn't pressed her for information she wasn't willing to give, he hadn't questioned her about whether she was dating someone.</p>
<p>Garrett turned a switch, and a series of small lights came on around the boat. Not enough to see each other well, but enough so that other boats would see them approaching. He pointed toward the blackness of the coast - "The inlet is right over there, between the lights" - and turned the wheel in that direction.</p>
<p>"So," he finally asked, "did you enjoy your first time sailing?"</p>
<p>"I did. It was wonderful."</p>
<p>"I'm glad."</p>
<p>They stood beside each other; both were lost in thought. Theresa noticed that the fog had made the horizon invisible.</p>
<p>As they moved closer to shore, Theresa suddenly doubted that they would see each other again. In a few minutes, they'd be back at the docks and they would say good-bye. She doubted he would ask her to join him again, and she wasn't going to ask him herself. For some reason it didn't seem like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>They made their way through the inlet, turning toward the marina. Soon the engine kicked to life, and within a few minutes, they reached his dock. She stood on the deck while Garrett jumped off and secured Happenstance with the lines.</p>
<p>Theresa walked to the stern to get the basket and her jacket, and then stopped. Thinking for a moment, she picked up the basket, but instead of grabbing her jacket, she pushed it partway under the seat cushion with her free hand. When Garrett asked if everything was okay, she cleared her throat and said, "I'm just getting my things." She walked to the side of the boat, and he offered his hand. Again, she felt the strength in it as she took it, and she stepped down from Happenstance onto the dock.</p>
<p>They stared at each other for just a moment, as if wondering what would come next, before Garrett finally motioned toward the boat. "I've got to close her up for the night, and it's going to take a little while."</p>
<p>She nodded. "I thought you might say that."</p>
<p>"Can I walk you to your car first?"</p>
<p>"Sure," she said, and he started down the dock with Theresa beside him. When they reached her rental car, Garrett watched as she fished through the basket for her keys. After finding them, she unlocked the car door and opened it.</p>
<p>"Like I said earlier, I had a wonderful time tonight," she said.</p>
<p>"So did I."</p>
<p>"You should take more people out. I'm sure they would enjoy it."</p>
<p>Grinning, he answered, "I'll think about it."</p>
<p>For a moment, their eyes met, and for a moment, he saw Catherine in the darkness.</p>
<p>"I'd better get back," he said quickly, slightly uncomfortable. "I've got an early morning tomorrow." She nodded, and not knowing what else to do, Garrett held out his hand. "It was nice meeting you, Theresa. I hope you enjoy the rest of your vacation."</p>
<p>"Thanks for everything, Garrett. It was nice meeting you, too."</p>
<p>She took her seat behind the steering wheel and turned the ignition. Garrett shut the door for her. Smiling at him one last time, she slowly backed the car out. Garrett waved and watched as her car finally left the marina. When she was safely on her way, he turned and walked back up the docks, wondering why he felt so unsettled.</p>

<p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p>
<p>"And then what happened?"</p>
<p>Jeb Blake leaned over his cup of coffee, speaking in a hoarse voice. Nearly seventy, he was lean and tall - almost too thin - and his face was deeply wrinkled. The thinning hair on his head was almost white. His arms were tattooed and scarred, and the knuckles on his hands were swollen from years of hard work as a shrimper. He still worked almost every day, though only part-time now, always leaving the house before daybreak and returning around noon.</p>
<p>"Nothing happened. She got into her car and drove away."</p>
<p>Rolling the first of the dozen cigarettes he would smoke a day, Jeb Blake stared at his son. For years his doctor told him he was killing himself by smoking, but because the doctor died of a heart attack at sixty, his father didn't put much faith in medical advice. Garrett assumed the old man would probably outlive him as well.</p>
<p>"Well, that's kind of a waste, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Garrett was surprised by his bluntness. "No, Dad, it wasn't a waste. I had a good time last night. She was easy to talk to, and I enjoyed her company."</p>
<p>"But you're not going to see her again."</p>
<p>Garrett took a drink of coffee and shook his head. "I doubt it. Like I said, she's here on vacation."</p>
<p>"For how long?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I didn't ask."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>Garrett reached for another packet of cream and added it to his coffee. "Why are you so interested, anyway? I went out sailing with someone and had a good time. There's not much more I can say about it."</p>
<p>"Sure there is."</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>"Like whether you enjoyed your date enough to start seeing other people again."</p>
<p>"Dad, we've discussed this before."</p>
<p>"I know, but I'm worried about you. You spend too much time alone these days."</p>
<p>"No, I don't."</p>
<p>"Yes," his father said with surprising softness, "you do."</p>
<p>"I don't want to argue about it, Dad."</p>
<p>"I don't, either. I've already tried that, and it doesn't work." He smiled. After a moment of silence, Jeb Blake tried another approach.</p>
<p>"So, what was she like?"</p>
<p>Garrett thought for a moment. "Theresa? She's attractive and intelligent. Very charming, too, in her own way."</p>
<p>"Is she single?"</p>
<p>"I think so. She's divorced."</p>
<p>Jeb studied his son's expression carefully as Garrett answered. When he finished, he leaned over his coffee again. "You liked her, didn't you?"</p>
<p>Looking his father in the eyes, Garrett knew he couldn't hide the truth. "Yeah, I did. But as I said, I probably won't see her again. I don't know where she's staying, and maybe she is leaving town today."</p>
<p>His father watched him in silence for a moment before asking the next question carefully. "But if she were still here and you knew where she was, do you think you would?"</p>
<p>Garrett looked away without answering, and Jeb reached across the table, taking his son's arm. Even at seventy, his hands were strong, and Garrett felt him applying just enough pressure to get his attention.</p>
<p>"Son, it's been three years now. I know you loved her, but it's okay to let it go now. You know that, don't you? You've got to be able to let it go."</p>
<p>It took a moment for him to answer. "I know, Dad. But it's not that easy."</p>
<p>"Nothing that's worthwhile is ever easy. Remember that."</p>
<p>A few minutes later, they finished their coffee. Garrett put a couple of dollars onto the table and followed his father out of the diner, toward his truck in the parking lot. When Garrett finally got to the shop, a dozen different things were going through his head.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Just before eleven, he finished most of what he needed to do and headed toward the front of the shop. Ian, one of his summertime employees, handed him three slips of paper. The first two were from distributors, and it seemed likely there had been a mix-up with some of the orders they had placed recently. "Another thing to take care of," he thought, starting back toward the office.</p>
<p>He read the third message as he was walking and stopped when he realized who it was from. Making sure it wasn't a mistake, he entered his office and closed the door behind him. He dialed the number.</p>
<p>Theresa Osborne was reading the paper when the phone rang and picked up on the second ring.</p>
<p>"Hey, Theresa, this is Garrett. There's a message here that you called."</p>
<p>She sounded pleased to hear from him. "Oh, hi, Garrett. Thanks for returning my call. How are you?"</p>
<p>Hearing her voice brought back memories of the evening before. Smiling to himself, he imagined what she looked like as she sat in her hotel room. "I'm fine, thanks. I was just going through some paperwork and I got your message. What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I left my jacket on the boat last night and I was wondering if you found it."</p>
<p>"I didn't, but I really wasn't looking that closely. Did you leave it in the cabin?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure."</p>
<p>Garrett paused for a moment. "Well, let me run down there and take a look. I'll call you back and let you know whether I found it."</p>
<p>"Is that too much trouble?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. It should just take a few minutes. Will you be there for a little while?"</p>
<p>"I should be."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll call you right back."</p>
<p>Garrett said good-bye and left the shop, walking quickly back to the marina. After stepping aboard Happenstance, he unlocked the cabin and went below. Not finding the jacket, he turned and glanced up the deck, and finally saw it near the stern, partially hidden under one of the seat cushions. He picked it up, made sure it wasn't stained, and then returned to the shop.</p>
<p>In his office again, he dialed the number written on the slip. This time Theresa picked up on the first ring.</p>
<p>"This is Garrett again. I found your jacket."</p>
<p>She sounded relieved. "Thanks. I appreciate your looking for it."</p>
<p>"It wasn't a problem at all."</p>
<p>She was quiet for a moment, as if deciding what to do. Finally, she said, "Could you hold it for me? I can be down at your shop in about twenty minutes to pick it up."</p>
<p>"I'd be glad to," he answered. After hanging up the phone, he leaned back in his chair, thinking about what had just happened. "She hasn't left town yet," he thought, "and I'm going to get to see her again." One thing had just made itself clear: he was definitely glad.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theresa arrived twenty minutes later, dressed in shorts and a low-necked sleeveless blouse that did wonderful things for her figure. When she entered the shop, both Ian and Garrett stared at her as she glanced around. When she saw Garrett, she smiled and called out, "Hi," from where she was standing. Garrett moved toward Theresa with her jacket in hand.</p>
<p>"Good as new," he said, offering it to her when she stepped close enough to take it. While she was on her way, Garrett had washed the grease off his hands and changed into one of the new T-shirts his store offered for sale. It wasn't spectacular, but it was better than the way he'd looked before. At least now he looked clean.</p>
<p>"Thanks for picking it up for me," she said, and there was something in her eyes that made the initial attraction he'd felt the day before begin to rise again. Absently he scratched the side of his face.</p>
<p>"I was glad to do it. I guess the wind forced it from plain view."</p>
<p>"I guess so," she said with a slight shrug, and Garrett watched as she adjusted the shoulder of her blouse with her hand. He didn't know if she was in a hurry, and he wasn't sure he wanted her to leave yet. He said the first words that came to mind:</p>
<p>"I had a good time last night."</p>
<p>"So did I."</p>
<p>Her eyes caught his as she said it, and Garrett smiled softly. He didn't know what else to say - it had been a long time since he'd been in a situation like this. Though he was always good with customers and strangers in general, this was completely different. He found himself shifting his weight from one leg to the other, feeling as if he were sixteen again. Finally she spoke.</p>
<p>"I feel like I owe you something for taking the time to do this."</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous. You don't owe me anything."</p>
<p>"Maybe not for picking up my jacket, but for last night as well."</p>
<p>He shook his head. "Not for that, either. I was glad you came."</p>
<p>I was glad you came. The words rolled through his head immediately after he spoke them. Two days ago, it was impossible for him to say them to anyone.</p>
<p>In the background, the phone rang, and the sound of it broke him from his thoughts. Buying time, he asked, "Did you come all the way down here just for your jacket, or were you going to do a little sightseeing as well?"</p>
<p>"I hadn't really planned on that. It's about lunchtime, and I was going to get a quick bite to eat." She looked at him expectantly. "Any recommendations?"</p>
<p>He thought for a moment before responding. "I like Hank's, down at the pier. The food is fresh, and the view is out of this world."</p>
<p>"Where is it, exactly?"</p>
<p>He motioned over his shoulder. "On Wrightsville Beach. You take the bridge over to the island and turn right. You can't miss it - just look for the signs to the pier. The restaurant is located right there "</p>
<p>"What kind of food do they have?"</p>
<p>"Mainly seafood. They have great shrimp and oysters, but if you want something other than seafood, they have burgers and things like that as well."</p>
<p>She waited to see if he would add anything else, and when he didn't, she glanced away, looking toward the windows. Still she stood there, and for the second time in a couple of minutes, Garrett felt awkward in her presence. What was it about her that made him feel this way? Finally, gathering himself, he spoke.</p>
<p>"If you'd like, I could show you the place. I'm getting hungry myself, and I'd be happy to take you there if you want some company."</p>
<p>She smiled. "I'd like that, Garrett."</p>
<p>He looked relieved. "My truck is out back. Do you want me to drive?"</p>
<p>"You know the way better than I do," she replied, and Garrett pointed the way, leading her through the shop and out the back door. Walking slightly behind him so that he couldn't see her expression, Theresa smiled to herself.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hank's had been in business since the pier was built and was frequented by locals and tourists alike. It was similar to the pier restaurants they had on Cape Cod - wooden floors, large windows offering a view of the Atlantic Ocean, pictures of trophy fish on the walls. Off to one side was a door that led to the kitchen, and Theresa saw plates of fresh seafood loaded on trays, carried by waiters and waitresses dressed in shorts and blue T-shirts with the name of the restaurant.</p>
<p>They took their seats at a table near the corner. On the table, there was a laminated menu. Glancing around, Theresa saw that nearly every table was occupied.</p>
<p>"It's crowded," she said, making herself comfortable.</p>
<p>"It always is. Even before Wrightsville Beach got popular with tourists, this place was kind of a legend. You can't even get in here on Friday or Saturday nights, unless you're willing to wait for a couple of hours."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because of the food and the prices. Every morning Hank gets a load of fresh fish and shrimp, and you can usually get out of here without spending more than ten dollars, including the tip. And that's with a couple of beers."</p>
<p>"Then we were lucky to get a table."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we were. But we got here before the locals come in."</p>
<p>She looked around the restaurant one last time before glancing at the menu. "So what do you recommend?"</p>
<p>"Do you like seafood?"</p>
<p>"I love it."</p>
<p>"Then go with the tuna or the dolphin. They're both delicious."</p>
<p>"Dolphin?"</p>
<p>He laughed under his breath. "Not Flipper. It's dolphin-fish. That's what we call it around here."</p>
<p>"I think I'll go with the tuna," she said with a wink, "just to make sure."</p>
<p>"You think I'd make up something like that?"</p>
<p>She spoke in a teasing voice. "I don't know what to think. We just met yesterday, remember. I don't know you well enough to be completely sure what you're capable of."</p>
<p>"I'm hurt," he said in the same voice, and she laughed. He laughed, too, and after a moment, she surprised him by reaching across the table and touching his arm briefly. Catherine, he suddenly realized, used to do the same thing to get his attention.</p>
<p>"Look over there," she said, nodding toward the windows, and Garrett turned his head. On the pier, an older man carried his fishing gear, looking completely normal except for the large parrot that was perched on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Garrett shook his head and smiled. "We get all kinds around here. It's not quite California, but give us a few years."</p>
<p>Theresa kept watching as the man with the bird wandered down the pier. "You should get yourself one of those to keep you company when you go sailing."</p>
<p>"And ruin my peace and quiet? Knowing my luck, the bird wouldn't talk. It would just squawk the whole time and probably bite off part of my ear the first time the wind shifted."</p>
<p>"But you'd look like a pirate."</p>
<p>"I'd look like an idiot."</p>
<p>"Oh, you're no fun," Theresa said with a mock frown. After a brief pause, she looked around. "So do they have anyone to serve you here, or do we have to catch and cook our own fish?"</p>
<p>"Damn Yankees," he mumbled while shaking his head, and she laughed again.</p>
<p>A few moments later, the waitress arrived and took their orders. Both Theresa and Garrett ordered beers, and after putting the order into the kitchen, the waitress brought two bottles to the table.</p>
<p>"No glasses?" she asked with a raised eyebrow after the waitress had left.</p>
<p>"Nope. This place is nothing if not classy."</p>
<p>"I can see why you like it so much."</p>
<p>"Is that a comment about my lack of taste?"</p>
<p>"Only if you're anxious about it."</p>
<p>"Now you sound like a psychiatrist."</p>
<p>"I'm not, but I am a mother, and that makes me something of an expert in human nature."</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>"It's what I tell Kevin."</p>
<p>Garrett took a sip of his beer. "Did you talk to him today?"</p>
<p>She nodded and took a drink as well. "Just for a few minutes. He was on his way to Disneyland when I called. He had early morning passes, so he couldn't talk that long. He wanted to be one of the first in line at the Indiana Jones ride."</p>
<p>"Is he having a good time with his father?"</p>
<p>"He's having a great time. David's always been good with him, but I think he tries to make up for the fact that he doesn't see Kevin that often. Whenever Kevin goes out there, he expects something fun and exciting."</p>
<p>Garrett looked at her curiously. "You sound like you're not so sure about it."</p>
<p>She hesitated before continuing. "Well, I just hope it doesn't lead to disappointment later. David and his new wife have started a family, and as soon as the baby gets a little older, I think it's going to be a lot harder for David and Kevin to be alone together."</p>
<p>Garrett leaned forward as he spoke. "It's impossible to protect your kids against disappointment in life."</p>
<p>"I know that, I really do. It's just that..."</p>
<p>She stopped, and Garrett gently finished her thoughts for her. "He's your son and you don't want to see him hurt."</p>
<p>"Exactly." Beads of condensation had formed on the outside of her bottle of beer, and Theresa began to peel off the label. Again, it was the same thing Catherine used to do, and Garrett took another drink of beer and forced his mind back to the conversation.</p>
<p>"I don't know what to say except that if Kevin's anything like you, I'm sure he'll end up all right."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>He shrugged. "No one's life is easy - yours included. You've had some hard times, too. I think that by watching you overcome difficulties, he'll learn how to do it as well."</p>
<p>"Now you sound like a psychiatrist."</p>
<p>"I'm just telling you what I learned growing up. I was about Kevin's age when my mom died of cancer. Watching my dad taught me that I had to go on with my life, no matter what happens."</p>
<p>"Did your dad ever remarry?"</p>
<p>"No," he said, shaking his head. "I think there were a few times that he wished he had, but he never got around to it."</p>
<p>So that's where it comes from. Like father, like son.</p>
<p>"Does he still live in town?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, he does. I see him a lot these days. We try to get together at least once a week. He likes to keep me on the straight and narrow."</p>
<p>She smiled. "Most parents do."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The food arrived a few minutes later, and they continued their conversation as they ate. This time Garrett spoke more than she did, telling her what it was like growing up in the South, and why he'd never leave. He also told her about some of the adventurous things that had happened while sailing or scuba diving. She listened, fascinated. Compared with the stories that the men told up in Boston - which usually focused on business accomplishments - his stories were completely new to her. He spoke about the thousands of different sea creatures he had seen on his dives and what it was like to sail through a storm that had come up unexpectedly and nearly overturned his boat.</p>
<p>Theresa watched him closely as he spoke, pleased that he had loosened up compared with the evening before. She still noticed the things she had last night - the lean face, his light blue eyes, and the easy way he moved. Yet there was energy in the way he spoke to her now, and she found the change appealing. He wasn't measuring every word he said now.</p>
<p>They finished their lunch. Garrett was right - the food was delicious. After the bill arrived, he put some money on the table and motioned for them to leave.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?"</p>
<p>"Whenever you are. And thanks for lunch. It was great."</p>
<p>As they walked out the front door, she fully expected that Garrett would want to return to the shop right away, but he surprised her by suggesting something different.</p>
<p>"How about a walk along the beach? It's usually a little cooler down by the water." When she said yes, he led her to the side of the pier and started down the steps, walking beside Theresa. Once they reached the beach, they turned toward the water, walking beneath the pier. The shade was refreshing in the midday heat, and when they reached the compact sand at the edge of the tide, both of them stopped for a moment to remove their shoes. All around them, families were crowded onto towels and splashing in the water.</p>
<p>They began to walk in silence, strolling beside each other.</p>
<p>"Have you spent a lot of time on the beaches while you've been here?" Garrett asked.</p>
<p>Theresa shook her head. "No. I only got here the day before yesterday. This is the first time I've been on the beach here."</p>
<p>"How do you like it?"</p>
<p>"It's beautiful."</p>
<p>"Is it like the beaches up north?"</p>
<p>"Some of them, but the water's a lot warmer here. Haven't you ever been to the coast up north?"</p>
<p>"I've never been outside North Carolina."</p>
<p>She smiled at him. "A real world traveler, huh?"</p>
<p>He laughed under his breath. "No, but I don't feel like I'm missing that much. I like it here and couldn't imagine a prettier place." After a few steps, he glanced at her and changed the subject: "So, how long are you staying in Wilmington?"</p>
<p>"Until Sunday. I have to go back to work on Monday."</p>
<p>He thought there were five more days.</p>
<p>"Do you know anyone else in town?"</p>
<p>"No. I came down here on my own."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I just wanted to visit. I'd heard some good things about the place, and I wanted to see it for myself."</p>
<p>He wondered about her answer. "Do you usually take vacations alone?"</p>
<p>"Actually, this is my first time."</p>
<p>It was a few moments before Garrett spoke again. "Can I ask you a personal question?"</p>
<p>"It depends on the question."</p>
<p>He stopped walking and picked up a couple of small seashells that caught his eye. After turning them over a few times, he handed them to her. "Are you seeing anyone up in Boston?"</p>
<p>She took the shells as she answered. "No."</p>
<p>Though he had expected the answer, he couldn't understand why someone like her would spend most of her evenings alone.</p>
<p>"Why not? A woman like you should have your pick of men."</p>
<p>She smiled at that. "Thanks, that's nice of you to say. But it's not that easy, especially when you have a son. There are a lot of things I have to consider when I meet someone." She paused. "But what about you? Are you seeing anyone right now?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "No."</p>
<p>"Then it's my turn to ask - why not?"</p>
<p>Garrett shrugged. "I guess I haven't met anyone I'd really like to see on a regular basis."</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>It was a moment of truth, and Garrett knew it. All he had to do was affirm his earlier statement and that would be the end of it. For a few steps, he didn't say anything.</p>
<p>He didn't look at her as he spoke, and Theresa moved closer so that she could hear him over the roar of the ocean.</p>
<p>"No, that's not all. To be honest, I haven't even tried to find someone."</p>
<p>Theresa watched him carefully as he spoke. He was looking straight ahead as if gathering his thoughts, but she could sense his reluctance as he went on.</p>
<p>"There was something I didn't tell you last night."</p>
<p>She felt something tighten inside, knowing exactly what was coming. Keeping her face neutral, she said simply, "Oh?"</p>
<p>"I was married once, too," he finally said. "For six years." He turned to her with an expression that made her flinch. "But she passed away."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said quietly.</p>
<p>Again, he stopped and picked up some seashells, only this time he didn't hand them to Theresa. After inspecting them casually, he threw one into the oncoming waves. Theresa watched it disappear into the ocean.</p>
<p>"It happened three years ago. Ever since then, I haven't been interested in dating, or even looking." He stopped for a moment, uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"It must get lonely sometimes."</p>
<p>"It does, but I try not to think about that too much. I keep busy at the shop - there's always something to do there - and it helps the days go by."</p>
<p>When he finished, he glanced at her with a weak smile. There, he'd said it. He'd wanted to tell someone other than his father for years, and he'd ended up telling it to a woman from Boston he barely knew. A woman who had somehow been able to open doors that he himself had nailed shut.</p>
<p>She said nothing. When he didn't add anything else, she asked, "What was she like?"</p>
<p>"Catherine?" Garrett's throat went dry. "Do you really want to know?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I do," she said in a gentle voice.</p>
<p>He threw another shell into the surf, gathering his thoughts. How could he hope to describe her in words? Yet part of him wanted to try, wanted Theresa of all people to understand.</p>
<p>He sighed and finally turned his head. Theresa was staring at him, waiting. He spoke softly.</p>
<p>"She was everything I ever wanted. She was beautiful and charming, with a quick sense of humor, and she supported me in everything I did. I'd known her practically my whole life - we went to school together. We got married a year after I graduated from UNC. We were married for six years before the accident, and they were the best six years I ever had. When she was taken away..." He paused as if he were at a loss for words. "I don't know whether I'll ever get used to being without her."</p>
<p>The way he spoke about Catherine made Theresa hurt for him. It wasn't just his voice, but the look on his face before he described her - as if torn between the beauty of his memories and the pain of remembering. Though the letters had been touching, they hadn't prepared her for this. "I already knew how he felt about her. There wasn't any reason to make him talk about it," she thought.</p>
<p>But there was, another voice in her head suddenly said. You had to see his reaction for yourself. You had to find out whether he was ready to put the past behind him.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Garrett absently tossed the remaining shells into the water. "I'm sorry about that," he said.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I told you about her. Or so much about me."</p>
<p>"It's okay, Garrett. I wanted to know. I asked you about her, remember?"</p>
<p>"I didn't want to sound like I did." He spoke as if he'd done something wrong. Theresa's reaction was almost instinctive.</p>
<p>Stepping toward him, she reached for his hand. Taking it slowly in hers, she squeezed it gently. When she looked at him, she saw surprise in his eyes, though he didn't try to pull away.</p>
<p>"You lost a wife - something that most people our age don't know anything about." He lowered his eyes as she struggled for the right words.</p>
<p>"Your feelings say a lot about you. You're the kind of person who loves someone forever... That's nothing to be ashamed of."</p>
<p>"I know. It's just that it's been three years..."</p>
<p>"Someday you'll find someone special again. People who've been in love once usually do. It's in their nature."</p>
<p>She squeezed his hand again, and Garrett felt her touch warm him. For some reason he didn't want to let go.</p>
<p>"I hope you're right," he said finally.</p>
<p>"I am. I know these things. I'm a mother, remember?"</p>
<p>He laughed under his breath, trying to release the tension he felt. "I remember. And you're probably a good one."</p>
<p>They turned around and started back to the pier, talking quietly about the last three years, still holding hands. By the time they reached his truck and headed back to the shop, Garrett was more confused than ever. The events of the past two days were just so unexpected. Theresa wasn't just a stranger anymore, nor was she just a friend. Of course, he was drawn to her. But then again, she'd be gone in a few days, and he knew that it was probably better that way.</p>
<p>''What are you thinking?" she asked. They made their way over the bridge toward Wilmington and Island Diving.</p>
<p>"I was thinking," he finally said, surprising himself, "that if you don't have plans tonight, I'd like to have you over for supper."</p>
<p>She smiled. "I was hoping you'd say that."</p>
<p>He was still surprised at himself for asking, as he turned left onto the road that led to his shop.</p>
<p>"Can you come by my place about eight? I have some things I have to do at the shop, and I probably won't be able to finish until late."</p>
<p>"That's fine. Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"On Carolina Beach. I'll give you directions when we get to the shop."</p>
<p>They pulled into the lot and Theresa followed Garrett into the office. He scribbled the directions on a slip of paper. Trying not to look as confused as he felt, he said:</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have any trouble finding the place. But if you have any problems, my number's at the bottom."</p>
<p>After she left, Garrett found himself thinking about the upcoming evening. As he sat in his office, two questions plagued him without answer. First, why was he so attracted to Theresa? And second, why did he suddenly feel as if he were betraying Catherine?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p>
<p>After work, Garrett drove first to the grocery store and picked up the items he needed for dinner. He showered and put on a pair of clean jeans and a light cotton shirt, then went to the refrigerator to get a beer. After opening it, he stepped out onto the back porch and sat in a chair. Checking his watch, he realized that Theresa would be here soon.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Garrett was still sitting on the back porch when he finally heard the sound of a motor making its way down the block. He went around the side of the house, watching as Theresa parked on the street, right behind his truck.</p>
<p>She stepped out wearing jeans and the same blouse she had worn earlier, the one that did wonderful things for her figure. She looked relaxed as she walked toward him, and when she smiled warmly at him, he realized that his attraction had grown stronger since their lunch this afternoon, and it made him a little uneasy for a reason he didn't want to admit.</p>
<p>He walked toward her as casually as he could, and Theresa met him halfway, carrying a bottle of white wine. When he got close to her, he smelled the scent of perfume, something she hadn't worn before.</p>
<p>"I brought some wine," she said, handing it to him. "I thought it might go well with dinner." Then, after a short pause: "How was your afternoon?"</p>
<p>"It was busy. Customers kept coming in until we closed, and I had a load of paperwork I had to get through. In fact, I just got home a little while ago." He started toward the front door, and Theresa was right beside him. "How about you? What did you end up doing the rest of the day?"</p>
<p>"I took a nap," she said as if teasing him, and he laughed.</p>
<p>"I forgot to ask you earlier, but do you want anything special for dinner?" he asked.</p>
<p>"What were you planning on?"</p>
<p>"I was thinking of cooking some steaks on the grill, but then I wondered if you ate things like that."</p>
<p>"Are you kidding? You forget I grew up in Nebraska. I love a good steak."</p>
<p>"Then you're in for a pleasant surprise."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I make the best steaks in the world."</p>
<p>"Oh, you do, huh?"</p>
<p>"I'll prove it to you," he said, and she laughed, a melodic sound.</p>
<p>As they approached the door, Theresa looked at the house for the first time. It was relatively small - one story - with painted wooden siding. Unlike the homes on Wrightsville Beach, this home sat directly on the sand. When she asked him why it wasn't raised like the other houses, he explained that the house was built long ago. "Now the houses have to be elevated so that the tidal flow can pass under the main structure. The next big hurricane will probably wash this old house out to sea, but I've been fortunate so far."</p>
<p>"Don't you worry about that?"</p>
<p>"Not really. There's not much to the place, and that's the only reason I could afford it. I think the former owner finally got tired of all the stress every time a big storm started moving across the Atlantic."</p>
<p>They reached the front steps and walked inside. The first thing Theresa noticed was the view from the main room. The windows extended from the floor to the ceiling and ran along the entire backside of the house, overlooking the back deck and Carolina Beach.</p>
<p>"This view is incredible," she said, surprised.</p>
<p>Off to one side was a fireplace, surrounded by a dozen underwater photographs. She moved toward them. "Do you mind if I look around?"</p>
<p>"No, go ahead. I have to get the grill out back ready anyway. It needs a bit of cleaning."</p>
<p>Garrett left through the sliding glass door.</p>
<p>After he left, Theresa looked at the pictures for a while, then toured the rest of the house. Like many beach houses she had seen, there wasn't room for more than one or two people to live here. There was only one bedroom, reached by a door off the living room. Like the main room, it also had floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the beach. The front portion of the house - the side closest to the street - contained a kitchen, a small dining area (not quite a room), and the bathroom. Though everything was tidy, the house looked as though it hadn't been updated in years.</p>
<p>Returning to the main room, she stopped at his bedroom and glanced inside. Again, she saw underwater photographs decorating the walls. In addition, there was a large map of the North Carolina coast that hung directly over his bed, documenting the location of almost five hundred shipwrecks. When she looked toward his nightstand, she saw a framed picture of a woman. Making sure that Garrett was still outside cleaning the grill, she stepped in to take a closer look.</p>
<p>Catherine was in her mid-twenties when it was taken. Like the photos on the walls, it looked as though Garrett had taken it himself. Picking it up, she saw that Catherine was attractive - a little more petite than she was - with blond hair that hung to mid-shoulder. Even though the picture was slightly grainy and looked as if it had been reproduced from a smaller photo, she still noticed Catherine's eyes. Deep green and almost catlike, they gave her an exotic look and almost seemed as if they were staring back at her. She put the photo down gently, making sure it was set in the same angle it was before. Turning around, she continued to feel as if Catherine were watching her every move.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there was only one more photo that included Catherine. It was a picture of Garrett and Catherine smiling broadly, standing on the deck of Happenstance. Because the boat looked as if it had already been restored, she assumed the picture had been taken only a few months before she died.</p>
<p>Knowing he could enter the house at any time, she left his bedroom, feeling a little guilty about poking around. She walked to the sliding glass doors that led from the main room onto the deck and opened them. Garrett was cleaning the grill top. He smiled at her when he heard her come out. She strolled to the edge of the deck where he was working and leaned against one of the rails.</p>
<p>"Did you take all the photos on the walls?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah. For a while there, I took my camera out on most of my dives. I hung most of them at the shop, but because I had so many, I thought I'd put some up here as well."</p>
<p>"They look professional."</p>
<p>"Thanks. But I took a lot of them. There were many that didn't come out."</p>
<p>He finished with the grill top. "Do you want anything to drink?"</p>
<p>Theresa asked, "What do you have?"</p>
<p>Garrett cleared his throat. "Beer, soda, or the wine you brought."</p>
<p>"A beer sounds good."</p>
<p>Garrett went inside, leaving the sliding glass door open.</p>
<p>While he was gone, Theresa turned and looked up and down the beach. Now that the sun was going down, most of the people were gone, and the few that were left were jogging or walking. Even though the beach wasn't crowded, more than a dozen people went past the house in the short time he was gone.</p>
<p>"Do you ever get tired of having all these people around?" she asked when he returned.</p>
<p>He handed her the beer. "Not really. Usually by the time I get home, the beach is pretty much deserted. And in the winter, no one is out here at all."</p>
<p>For just a moment, she imagined him sitting on his deck, watching the water, alone as always. Garrett reached into his pocket and took out a box of matches. He lit the charcoals. The light breeze made the fire dance in circles.</p>
<p>"Now that the coals are started, I'm going to get supper going."</p>
<p>"Can I help?"</p>
<p>"There's not much to do," he answered. "But if you're lucky, maybe I'll share my secret recipe with you."</p>
<p>He winked at her and she laughed before following him inside, to the kitchen. Garrett opened one of the cabinets and pulled out a couple of potatoes. Standing in front of the sink, he washed his hands first and then the potatoes. After turning on the oven, he wrapped the potatoes in foil and set them on the rack.</p>
<p>"What can I do?"</p>
<p>"Like I said, not much. I think I've got it pretty much in control. I bought one of those prepackaged salads, and there's not anything else on the menu."</p>
<p>Theresa stood off to one side as Garrett put the last of the potatoes in the oven and got the salad out of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>From the corner of his eye, he glanced at her as he emptied the salad into a bowl. What was it about her that made him suddenly want to be as close to her as possible? Wondering, he opened the refrigerator and pulled out the steaks. Then he reached for a couple of tomatoes that were on the counter and began dicing.</p>
<p>"It sounds like you have a great relationship with Kevin."</p>
<p>"I do. I just hope it continues. He's almost a teenager now, and I worry that when he gets older, he's going to want to spend less time with me."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't worry too much. From the way you talk about him, I would think that you two will always be close."</p>
<p>"I hope so. Right now, he's all I have - I don't know what I'd do if he started to shut me out of his life. I have some friends with boys a little older than he is, and they tell me it's inevitable."</p>
<p>"I'm sure he's going to change somewhat. Everyone does, but that doesn't mean he won't talk to you."</p>
<p>She looked over at him. "Are you talking from experience or just telling me what I want to hear?"</p>
<p>He shrugged, again noticing her perfume. "I'm just remembering what I went through with my father. We'd always been close growing up, and it didn't change when I started high school. I started doing different things and seeing my friends more, but we still talked all the time."</p>
<p>"I hope it's the same way for me," she said.</p>
<p>With the preparation under way, a peaceful silence descended upon them. The simple act of cutting tomatoes with her by his side eased some of the anxiety he'd felt up to this point. Theresa was the first woman he'd invited to this house, and Garrett realized there was something comfortable about having her here.</p>
<p>When he finished, Garrett put the tomatoes in the salad bowl and wiped his hands on a paper towel. Then he bent over to remove his second beer.</p>
<p>"Are you up for another?"</p>
<p>She drained the last of her bottle, surprised she had finished so quickly. She nodded, setting the empty bottle on the counter. Garrett twisted off the bottle cap and handed her another, opening one for himself. Theresa was relaxing against the counter, and when she took the bottle, something about the way she was standing struck him as familiar: the smile playing across her lips, maybe.</p>
<p>He swallowed hard, suddenly aware of the stillness in the kitchen. "I'm going to check the coals to see how they're doing," he said, needing something, anything, to do. "Hopefully, they're getting close."</p>
<p>"Can I set the table while you're checking?"</p>
<p>"Sure. Most of the things you'll need are right over here."</p>
<p>After showing her where to find what she needed, he headed outside, forcing himself to relax and clearing his mind of the ghostly memories. The ocean air was fresh, and for the first time, he suddenly realized that despite his vision of Catherine just moments ago, he was still pleased that Theresa was here. In fact, he felt happy, something he hadn't felt in a long time.</p>
<p>It wasn't only in the way they got along, but it was little things Theresa did. The way she smiled, the way she looked at him, even the way she'd taken his hand earlier this afternoon - it was already beginning to feel as if he knew her longer than he actually did. He wondered whether it was because she was similar to Catherine in so many ways or whether his father had been right about him needing to spend some time with another person.</p>
<p>While he was outside, Theresa set the table. She put a wineglass beside each plate and sorted through the drawer for some silverware. Beside the utensils were two candles with small holders for each. After wondering whether it would be too much, she decided to put them on the table as well. Garrett came in just as she was finishing up.</p>
<p>"Would you like to sit outside?" he asked.</p>
<p>Theresa picked up her beer and followed him out. She sat in one of the chairs, Garrett right beside her. Theresa watched him as he stared out over the water. She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling more alive than she had in a long time.</p>
<p>"I bet you don't have a view like this from where you live in Boston," he said into the sudden silence.</p>
<p>"You're right," she said, "I don't. I live in an apartment. My parents think I'm crazy for living downtown. They think I should live in the suburbs."</p>
<p>"Why don't you?"</p>
<p>"I used to, before the divorce. But now, it's just a lot easier. I can get to work in just a few minutes, Kevin's school is right down the block, and I never have to take the highway unless I'm going out of town. Besides, I wanted something different after my marriage ended. I just couldn't handle the looks my neighbors gave me after they found out that David had left."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>She shrugged, and her voice softened. "I never told any of them why David and I separated. I just didn't think it was any of their business."</p>
<p>"It wasn't."</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, remembering. "I know that, but in their minds, David was a wonderful husband. He was handsome and successful, and they didn't want to believe that he did anything wrong. Even when we were together, he acted as if everything were perfect. I didn't have any idea he was having an affair until the very end."</p>
<p>She turned toward him. "As they say, the wife is always the last to know."</p>
<p>"How did you find out?"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "I know it sounds like a cliche, but I found out from the dry cleaner, of all people. When I picked up his clothes, the cleaner handed me some receipts that had been in his pocket. One was from a hotel downtown. And I knew from the date that he had been home that evening, so it had been for just an afternoon. He denied it when I confronted him, but by the way he looked at me, I knew he was lying. Eventually, the whole story came out, and I filed for divorce."</p>
<p>Garrett listened quietly, letting her finish, and she went on:</p>
<p>"You know, David was one of those men who could say anything and make you believe it. I think he even believed most of the things he told me. We met in college. He was smart and charming, and I was flattered that he was interested in someone like me. Here I was, a young girl straight from Nebraska, and he was unlike anyone I'd ever met before. And when we got married, I thought I'd have a storybook life. But I guess it was the furthest thing from his mind. I found out later that he had his first affair only five months after we were married."</p>
<p>She stopped for a moment, and Garrett looked toward his beer. "I don't know what to say."</p>
<p>"There's nothing you can say," she said. "It's over, and like I said yesterday, the only thing I want from him now is for him to be a good father to Kevin."</p>
<p>"You make it sound so easy."</p>
<p>"I don't mean to. David hurt me pretty badly, and it took me a couple of years and more than a few sessions with a good therapist to get to this point. I learned a lot from my therapist, and I learned a lot about myself along the way. Once, when I was babbling about what a jerk he had been, she pointed out that if I kept holding on to my anger, he'd still be controlling me, and I wasn't willing to accept that. So I let it go."</p>
<p>She took another sip of her beer. Garrett asked, "Did your therapist say anything else that you remember?"</p>
<p>She thought for a moment, and then smiled faintly. "As a matter of fact, she did. She said that if I ever came across someone who reminded me of David that I should turn around and run for the hills."</p>
<p>"Do I remind you of David?"</p>
<p>"Not in the slightest. You're about as different from David as a man can get."</p>
<p>"That's good," he said with mock seriousness. "There aren't many hills in this part of the country, you know. You'd have to run a mighty long way."</p>
<p>She giggled, and Garrett looked over at the grill and saw that the coals were ready.</p>
<p>After returning to the grill with the steaks he asked, "How do you like your steak?"</p>
<p>"Medium rare."</p>
<p>"With steaks this size, that's about eleven minutes on each side."</p>
<p>She raised her eyebrows. "You're very precise about all this, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"I promised you a good steak, and I intend to deliver."</p>
<p>In the little while it took to cook the steaks, Garrett watched Theresa out of the corner of his eye. The sky was turning orange, and the warm light made her look especially beautiful, darkening her brown eyes.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking?"</p>
<p>He tensed at the sound of her voice, suddenly realizing he hadn't said anything since he'd started cooking.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking about what a jerk your ex-husband was," he said, turning toward her, and he saw her smile. She patted his shoulder gently.</p>
<p>"But if I was still married, I wouldn't be here with you."</p>
<p>"And that," he said, still feeling her touch, "would be a shame."</p>
<p>"Yes, it would," she echoed, their eyes lingered for a moment. Finally, Garrett turned away.</p>
<p>He finished what he was doing and took another drink of beer, wetting his throat. She turned toward him.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Garrett, what do you think about when you're out here alone?"</p>
<p>"A lot of things."</p>
<p>"Anything in particular?"</p>
<p>I think about Catherine, he wanted to say but didn't.</p>
<p>He sighed. "No, not really. Sometimes I think about work, sometimes I think about the new places I want to explore on my dives. Other times, I dream about sailing away and leaving everything behind."</p>
<p>She watched him carefully as he spoke the last words. "Could you really do that? Sail away and never come back?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, but I like to think I could. Unlike you, I don't have any family except for my father, and in a way, I think he'd understand. He and I are a lot alike."</p>
<p>"But that would be like running away."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"Why would you want to do that?" she pressed, somehow knowing the answer. When he didn't respond, she leaned close to him and spoke gently.</p>
<p>"Garrett, I know it's not any of my business, but you can't run away from what you're going through." She gave him a reassuring smile. "And besides, you've got so much to offer someone."</p>
<p>Garrett stayed silent, thinking about what she'd said, wondering how she knew exactly what to say to make him feel better.</p>
<p>For the next few minutes, the only sounds around them came from elsewhere. Garrett turned the steaks. The gentle evening breeze made a distant wind chime sing. Waves rolled up on the shore with a soothing, continuous roar.</p>
<p>Garrett's mind drifted through the last two days. He thought about the moment when he'd first seen her, the hours they'd spent on Happenstance, and their walk on the beach earlier in the day when he'd first told her about Catherine. The tension he'd felt earlier in the day was almost gone now, and as they stood beside each other in the deepening twilight, he sensed that there was something more to this evening than either of them wanted to admit.</p>
<p>Just before the steaks were ready, Theresa went back inside to get the rest of the table ready. She pulled the potatoes out of the oven, unwrapped the foil, and placed one on each plate. The salad came next, and she set it in the middle of the table. Last, she put down salt, pepper, butter, and a couple of napkins. It was getting dark inside the house. On impulse, she lit the candles, standing back from the table to see if it was too much. Thinking it looked about right, she picked up the bottle of wine. She was placing it on the table just as Garrett came inside.</p>
<p>After closing the sliding glass door, Garrett saw what she had done. It was dark in the kitchen except for the small flames pointing upward, and the glow made Theresa look beautiful. Her dark hair looked mysterious in the candlelight, and her eyes seemed to capture the moving flames. Unable to speak for a long moment, all Garrett could do was stare at her, and it was in that moment that he knew exactly what he'd been trying to deny to himself all along.</p>
<p>"I thought these would be a nice touch," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"I think you're right."</p>
<p>They continued to watch each other from across the room, both frozen for a moment by the shadow of distant possibilities. Then Theresa glanced away.</p>
<p>"I couldn't find a wine opener," she said, grasping for something to say.</p>
<p>"I'll get it," he said quickly. "I don't use it very often, so it's probably buried in one of the drawers."</p>
<p>He carried the plate of steaks to the table, and then went to the drawer. He found the opener and brought it to the table. In a couple of easy moves, he opened the bottle and poured just the right amount into each glass. Then, sitting down, he put the steaks on each of their plates.</p>
<p>"It's the moment of truth," she said right before taking her first bite. Garrett smiled as he watched her try it. Theresa was pleasantly surprised to find out that he had been right.</p>
<p>"Garrett, this is delicious," she said earnestly.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>The candles burned lower as the evening wore on, and Garrett twice told her how glad he was that she had come this evening. Both times Theresa felt something tingle in the back of her neck and had to take another sip of wine just to make the feeling go away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After dinner, Garrett suggested another walk along the beach. "It's really beautiful at night," he said. When she agreed, he picked up the plates and silverware from the table and put them in the sink.</p>
<p>They left the kitchen and walked outside. The night was mild. They stepped off the deck, making their way over a small sand dune and onto the beach itself.</p>
<p>When they reached the water's edge, they slipped off their shoes and left them on the beach. They walked slowly, close to each other. Surprising her, Garrett reached for her hand. Feeling his warmth, Theresa wondered for just a moment what it would be like to have him touch her body. The thought made something inside her tighten, and when she glanced over at him, she wondered if he knew what she'd been thinking.</p>
<p>They continued strolling. "I haven't had a night like this in a long time," Garrett said finally.</p>
<p>"Neither have I," she said.</p>
<p>The sand was cool beneath their feet. "Garrett, do you remember when you first asked me to go sailing?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why did you ask me to go with you?"</p>
<p>He looked at her curiously. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that you looked almost like you regretted it the moment you said it."</p>
<p>He shrugged. "I'm not sure that regret is the word I'd use. I think I was surprised that I asked, but I didn't regret it."</p>
<p>She smiled. "Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm sure. You have to remember that I haven't asked anyone out in over three years. When you said that you had never gone sailing before - I think it just hit me that I was tired of always being alone."</p>
<p>"You mean I was in the right place at the right time?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "I didn't mean it to sound like that. These last couple of days have been the best days I've had in a long time."</p>
<p>She felt warm inside at what he'd said. As they walked, she felt him slowly moving his thumb, tracing small circles on her skin. He went on.</p>
<p>"Did you think your vacation would be anything like this?"</p>
<p>She hesitated, deciding it wasn't the right time to tell him the truth.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>They walked together quietly.</p>
<p>"Do you think you'll ever come back here again? I mean for another vacation?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I was hoping you would."</p>
<p>In the distance, she could see lights along a faraway pier. Again, she felt his hand moving against hers.</p>
<p>"Would you make dinner for me again if I did?"</p>
<p>"I'd cook you anything you want. As long as it's a steak."</p>
<p>She laughed under her breath. "Then I'll consider it. I promise."</p>
<p>"How about if I threw in a few scuba lessons as well?"</p>
<p>"I think Kevin would enjoy that more than me."</p>
<p>"Then bring him along."</p>
<p>She glanced over at him. "You wouldn't mind?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. I'd love to meet him."</p>
<p>"I bet you'd like him."</p>
<p>"I know I would."</p>
<p>They walked along in silence, until Theresa blurted out, "Garrett - can I ask you something?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"I know this is going to sound strange, but..."</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, and he looked at her quizzically. "What?"</p>
<p>"What's the worst thing you've ever done?"</p>
<p>He laughed aloud. "Where did that come from?"</p>
<p>"I just want to know. I always ask people that question. It lets me know what people are really all about."</p>
<p>"The worst thing?"</p>
<p>"The absolute worst."</p>
<p>He thought for a moment. "I guess I would say that the worst thing I've ever done is when a bunch of my friends and I went out one night in December - we were drinking when we ended up driving by a street that was totally decorated in Christmas lights. Well, we parked and right there and then proceeded to unscrew and steal every light bulb we could."</p>
<p>"You didn't!"</p>
<p>"We did. There were five of us, and we filled the back of the truck with stolen Christmas lights. We were out there for almost two hours, laughing loudly about what we were doing."</p>
<p>"That's terrible!"</p>
<p>He laughed again. "I know. Thinking back, I know it was terrible. But at the time, it was hilarious."</p>
<p>"And here I was, thinking you're such a nice guy..."</p>
<p>"I am a nice guy."</p>
<p>"So what else did you and your friends do?"</p>
<p>"Do you really want to know?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I do."</p>
<p>He told her then tales of other teenage misadventures, like soaping car windows. Twenty minutes later, he was still telling stories, much to her amusement. When he finally finished, he asked her the same question that had originally started the conversation.</p>
<p>"Oh, I've never done anything like you," she said almost shyly. "I've always been a good girl."</p>
<p>He laughed again then, knowing well that she wasn't telling the truth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They walked the full length of the beach, exchanging additional stories from childhood. Theresa tried to imagine him as a young man while he spoke. They stopped for a moment and looked out over the water. He stood close to her.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking?" Garrett asked.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking how nice the silence is with you."</p>
<p>He smiled. "And I was just thinking that I've told you a lot of things I don't tell anyone."</p>
<p>"Is that because you know I'm going back to Boston and I won't tell anyone?"</p>
<p>He chuckled. "No, it's not that at all."</p>
<p>"Then what is it?"</p>
<p>He looked at her curiously. "You don't know?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>She smiled when she said it. He wondered how to explain something he had difficulty understanding himself. Then, after a long moment in which he gathered his thoughts, he spoke quietly:</p>
<p>"I guess it's because I wanted you to know who I really am. Because if you really know me, and still want to spend time with me..."</p>
<p>Theresa said nothing but knew exactly what he was trying to say. Garrett looked away.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p>"It didn't make me feel uncomfortable," Theresa began. "I'm glad you said it..."</p>
<p>She paused. After a moment, they slowly started walking again.</p>
<p>"But you don't feel the same way I do."</p>
<p>She looked over at him. "Garrett... I..."</p>
<p>"No, you don't have to say anything -"</p>
<p>She didn't let him finish. "Yes, I do. You want an answer, and I want to tell you." She paused, thinking of the best way to say it. Then, taking a deep breath, she said: "After David and I split up, I went through an awful period. And just when I thought I was getting over it, I started to date again. But the men I met... I don't know... It just seemed like the world changed while I was married. They all wanted things, but none of them wanted to give."</p>
<p>"I don't know what to say..."</p>
<p>"Garrett, I'm telling you this because I think you're not like that. I think you're the furthest thing from it. And it scares me a little. Because if I tell you how much I care for you... in a way, I'm telling myself the same thing. And if I do that, then I guess I'm opening up myself to get hurt again."</p>
<p>"I'd never hurt you," he said gently.</p>
<p>She stopped walking and made him face her. She spoke quietly.</p>
<p>"I know you believe that, Garrett. But you've been dealing with your own demons for the past three years. I don't know if you're ready to go on yet, and if you're not, then I'm going to be the one who gets hurt."</p>
<p>The words hit hard, and it took a moment for him to respond. Garrett willed her to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>"Theresa... since we met... I don't know..."</p>
<p>He stopped, realizing that he wasn't able to put into words the way he was feeling.</p>
<p>Instead, he raised his hand and touched the side of her face with his finger, tracing so lightly that it felt almost like a feather against her skin. The moment he touched her, she closed her eyes and despite her uncertainty let the tingling feeling travel through her body, warming her.</p>
<p>With that, she felt everything begin to slip away, and suddenly it felt right to be here. The dinner they had shared, their walk on the beach, the way he was looking at her now - she couldn't imagine anything better than what was happening at this very moment.</p>
<p>Waves rolled up on the beach, wetting their feet. The warm summer breeze blew through her hair, heightening the sensation of his touch. The moonlight made the landscape seem almost unreal.</p>
<p>They gave in then to everything that had been building since the moment when they met. She sank into him, feeling the warmth of his body, and he released her hand. Then, slowly wrapping both arms around her, he drew her against him and kissed her softly on the lips. After pulling back slightly to look at her, he gently kissed her again. She kissed him back, feeling his hand run up along her back and settle into her hair, burying his fingers in it.</p>
<p>They stood with their arms around each other, kissing in the moonlight for a long time, and neither of them was caring if anyone could see them. They had both waited too long for this moment, and when they finally pulled back, they stared at each other. Then, taking his hand again, Theresa slowly led him back to his house.</p>
<p>It seemed like a dream as they moved inside. Garrett kissed her again immediately after closing the door, more passionately this time, and Theresa felt her body tremble with anticipation. She walked to the kitchen, picked up the two candles from the table, and led him to the bedroom. She put the candles on his bureau, and he pulled the matches from his pocket, lighting them as she walked to the windows and began to close the curtains...</p>
<p>Kissing softly, they made love with a passion that kept silent for the last three years.</p>
<p>Finally, Theresa fell asleep in his arms, and Garrett watched as she slept beside him. Just before he fell asleep, he gently brushed her hair from her face, trying hard to remember everything.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Right before daybreak, Theresa opened her eyes, realizing instinctively that he was gone. She turned in the bed, looking for him. Not seeing him, she rose and went to his closet, finding a bathrobe. Wrapping it around her, she left the bedroom and glanced toward the darkness of the kitchen. Not there. She looked in the living room, but he wasn't there, either.</p>
<p>Stepping outside, she found him sitting in the chair. Turning around, he saw her and smiled.</p>
<p>"Hey there."</p>
<p>She stepped toward him, and he motioned for her to sit on his lap. He kissed her as he pulled her to him, and she put her arms around his neck. Then, pulling back when she sensed that something was wrong, she touched his cheek.</p>
<p>"You all right?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for him to answer.</p>
<p>"Yeah," he said, quietly, without looking at her.</p>
<p>"You're sure?"</p>
<p>He nodded, again without meeting her eyes, and she used her finger to make him face her. She said gently:</p>
<p>"You look sort of... sad."</p>
<p>He gave a weak smile without answering.</p>
<p>"Are you sad about what happened?"</p>
<p>"No," he said. "Not at all. I don't regret any of it."</p>
<p>"Then what is it?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer, and again his eyes shifted away.</p>
<p>She spoke softly. "Are you out here because of Catherine?"</p>
<p>He waited for a moment without answering, then took her hand in his. Finally, he met her gaze.</p>
<p>"No. I'm not out here because of Catherine," he said, almost whispering the words. "I'm out here because of you."</p>
<p>Then, with a tenderness that reminded her of a small child, he gently pulled her close and held her without saying another word, not letting go until the sky began to lighten and the first person appeared on the beach.</p>

<p>CHAPTER NINE</p>
<p>"What do you mean, you can't have lunch with me today? We've been doing this for years - how could you forget?"</p>
<p>"I didn't forget, Dad, I just can't do it today. We'll pick it up again next week, okay?"</p>
<p>Jeb Blake paused on the other end of the phone, drumming his fingers on the desktop.</p>
<p>"Why do I get the feeling you're not telling me something?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing to tell."</p>
<p>"You're sure?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm sure."</p>
<p>Theresa called to Garrett from the shower, asking him to bring her a towel. Garrett covered the mouthpiece and told her he'd be right there. When he returned his attention to the phone, he heard his father inhale sharply.</p>
<p>"What was that?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>Then, in a tone of sudden understanding: "That Theresa is there, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Knowing he couldn't hide the truth from him now, Garrett replied, "Yeah, she's here."</p>
<p>Jeb whistled, obviously pleased. "It's about time."</p>
<p>"Dad, don't make a big deal out of this..."</p>
<p>"I won't - I promise."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"But can I ask you something?"</p>
<p>"Sure." Garrett sighed.</p>
<p>"Does she make you happy?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for him to answer. "Yeah, she does," he said finally.</p>
<p>"It's about time," he said again with a laugh before hanging up. Garrett stared at the phone as he replaced it in its cradle.</p>
<p>"She really does," he whispered to himself with a small smile on his face. "She really does."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theresa emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later, looking rested and fresh. Smelling coffee brewing, she went to the kitchen for a cup. After putting a piece of bread in the toaster, Garrett walked to her side.</p>
<p>"Good morning, again," he said, kissing the back of her neck.</p>
<p>"Good morning again to you, too."</p>
<p>"Sorry about leaving the bedroom last night."</p>
<p>"Hey, it's okay... I understand."</p>
<p>"You mean that?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do." She turned and faced him with a smile. "I had a wonderful night."</p>
<p>"So did I," he said. Taking a coffee cup out of the cupboard for Theresa, he asked over his shoulder, "Do you want to do something today? I called the shop and told them I wasn't coming in."</p>
<p>"What did you have in mind?"</p>
<p>"How about showing you around Wilmington?"</p>
<p>"We could do that." She didn't sound convinced.</p>
<p>"Did you have anything else you wanted to do instead?"</p>
<p>"What if we just stay here today?"</p>
<p>"And do what?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I can think of a couple of things," she said, putting her arms around him. "That is, if you don't have a problem with that."</p>
<p>"No," he said with a smile. "No problem at all."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>For the next four days, Theresa and Garrett were inseparable. Garrett gave control of the shop to Ian, even allowing him to teach the dive classes on Saturday, something he'd never done before. Twice, Garrett and Theresa went sailing; on the second night, they stayed out all night on the ocean, lying together in the cabin, rocked by the gentle swells of the Atlantic. Later that evening she asked him to tell her more adventure stories about early sailors, and she stroked his hair as the sound of his voice echoed against the interior of the hull.</p>
<p>What she didn't know was that after she'd fallen asleep, Garrett left her side as he had their first night together and paced the deck alone. He thought about Theresa sleeping inside and the fact that she would be leaving soon.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The following day was spent at the beach, sitting near the pier where they'd first had lunch. They had lunch at Hank's again, holding hands and staring at each other from across the table. They talked quietly, oblivious to the people around them, and neither one of them noticed when the check was brought to the table and the lunch crowd emptied out.</p>
<p>Theresa watched him carefully, wondering if Garrett had been as intuitive with Catherine as he was with her. It was as if he could almost read her mind whenever they were together - if she wanted him to hold her hand, he reached for it before she said anything. If she just wanted to talk for a while without interruption, he listened quietly. If she wanted to know how he was feeling about her at any particular moment, the way he looked at her made it all clear. No one - not even David - had ever understood her as well as Garrett seemed to, yet how long had she known him? A few days? How, she wondered, could that be? Late at night, she thought about the answer as he lay sleeping by her side, and the answer always came back to the bottles she had originally found. The more she had come to know Garrett, the more she believed that she was destined to find his messages to Catherine, as if there were some great force that had directed them to her, with the intention of bringing them together.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, Garrett cooked another dinner for her, which they ate on the back deck under the stars. After making love, they lay in his bed, holding each other. Both of them knew that she had to return to Boston the following day. They had both avoided talking about it until now.</p>
<p>"Will I ever see you again?" she asked.</p>
<p>He was quiet, almost too quiet. "I hope so," he said finally.</p>
<p>"Do you want to?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do." As he said it, he sat up in the bed, pulling slightly away from her. After a moment, she sat up and turned on the bedside lamp.</p>
<p>"What is it, Garrett?"</p>
<p>"I just don't want it to end," he said, looking down. "I don't want us to end; I don't want this week to end. I mean, you come into my life and turn it upside-down, and now you're leaving."</p>
<p>She reached for his hand and spoke quietly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Garrett - I don't want it to end, either. This has been one of the best weeks I've ever had. It seems like I've known you forever. We can make it work, if we try. I could come down here or you could come up to Boston. Either way, we can try, can't we?"</p>
<p>"How often would I see you? Once a month? Less than that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I think that depends on us and on what we're willing to do. I think if we're both willing to give a little, we can make it work."</p>
<p>He paused for a long moment. "Do you really think it's possible if we don't see each other very much? When would I get to hold you? When would I be able to see your face? If we only see each other once in a while, we won't be able to do the things that we need to... to continue feeling the way we do. Every time we saw each other, we'd know it's only for a couple of days. There wouldn't be time for anything to grow."</p>
<p>His words stung. Partly from the truth and partly because it seemed he wanted to simply end it here and now. When he finally turned to her, with a regretful smile on his face, she didn't know what to say. She released his hand, confused.</p>
<p>"You don't want to try, then? Is that what you're saying? You just want to forget everything that's happened -"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "No - I don't want to forget it. I can't forget it. I don't know... I just want to see you more than it sounds like we'll be able to."</p>
<p>"So do I. But we can't, so let's just make the best of what we can. Okay?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "I don't know..."</p>
<p>She watched him closely as he spoke, sensing the presence of something else.</p>
<p>"Garrett, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer, and she went on. "Is there a reason you don't want to try?"</p>
<p>Still he remained quiet. In the silence, he turned toward Catherine's picture on the nightstand.</p>
<p>"Garrett, talk to me."</p>
<p>She stared at him, concerned. Finally he spoke:</p>
<p>"Theresa... it's just so hard right now. The things I've been going through..."</p>
<p>He trailed off, and Theresa suddenly knew what he was talking about. She felt her stomach tighten.</p>
<p>"Is this about Catherine? Is that what this is about?"</p>
<p>"No, it's just that..." He paused, and she knew with a sudden sureness that she'd been right.</p>
<p>"It is, isn't it? You don't want to even try with us... because of Catherine."</p>
<p>"You just don't understand."</p>
<p>Despite herself, she felt a flash of anger. "Oh, I understand. You were able to spend time with me this week, simply because you knew I'd be leaving. And then, once I was gone, you could go back to what you had before. I was just a fling, wasn't I?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "No, you weren't. You weren't a fling. I really care about you -"</p>
<p>She stared hard at him. "But not enough to even try to make this work."</p>
<p>He looked at her, and pain was evident in his eyes. "Don't be like this..."</p>
<p>"How should I be? Understanding? Do you want me to say, Oh, okay, Garrett, we'll just end it here because it's difficult and we won't be able to see each other very much. I understand. It was nice meeting you.' Is that what you want me to say?"</p>
<p>"No, that's not what I want you to say."</p>
<p>"Then what do you want? I've already said I'm willing to try... I've already said that I'd like to try -"</p>
<p>He shook his head, unable to meet her eyes. Theresa could feel tears beginning to form.</p>
<p>"Look, Garrett, I know you lost a wife. I know you suffered terribly for it. But you're acting like a martyr now. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Don't throw it all away by living in the past."</p>
<p>"I'm not living in the past," he said defensively.</p>
<p>Theresa fought back her tears with effort. Her voice softened.</p>
<p>"Garrett... I may not have lost a wife, but I lost someone I really cared about, too. I know all about pain and hurt. But to be frank, I'm tired of being alone all the time. It's been over three years for me - just like you - and I'm tired of it. I'm ready to go on now and find someone special to be with. And you should, too."</p>
<p>"I know that. Don't you think I know that?"</p>
<p>"Right now, I'm not so sure. Something wonderful has happened between us, and I don't want us to lose sight of that."</p>
<p>He paused for a long moment.</p>
<p>"You're right," he began, struggling with his words. "In my mind, I know you're right. But my heart... I just don't know."</p>
<p>"But what about my heart? Doesn't that matter to you at all?"</p>
<p>The way she looked at him made his throat tighten.</p>
<p>"Of course it does. It matters more than you think." When he reached out to take her hand, she flinched and he saw how much he had hurt her. He spoke gently, trying to control his own emotions.</p>
<p>"Theresa, I'm sorry for putting you - putting us - through this on our last night. I didn't mean for it to happen. Believe me, you weren't a fling for me. God - you were anything but that. I told you I really care about you, and I mean that."</p>
<p>He opened his arms his eyes were pleading with her to come to his side. She hesitated for a second, and then finally leaned into him, while myriad conflicting feelings were rushing through her. She lowered her face onto his chest, not wanting to see his expression. He kissed her hair, speaking softly.</p>
<p>"I really care. I care so much that it scares me. I haven't felt like this in so long, it's almost like I've forgotten how important another person could be to me. I don't think I could just let you go and forget you, and I don't want to. And I definitely don't want us to end right now." For a moment, there was only the soft, even sound of his breathing Finally he whispered, "I promise to do everything I can to see you. And we'll try to make it work."</p>
<p>The tenderness in his voice made her tears begin to fall. He went on, almost too quietly for her to hear.</p>
<p>"Theresa, I think I'm in love with you."</p>
<p>I think I'm in love with you, she heard again. I think...</p>
<p>I think...</p>
<p>Not wanting to respond, she simply whispered, "Just hold me, okay? Let's not talk anymore."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They made love first thing in the morning and held each other until the sun had risen high enough to let them know it was time for Theresa to get ready. Even though she hadn't spent much time at all at the hotel and had brought her suitcase over to Garrett's house, she hadn't checked out, just in case Kevin or Deanna called.</p>
<p>Garrett made Theresa breakfast while she finished packing her things. When she walked into the kitchen, Garrett was sitting at the table, drinking coffee.</p>
<p>He winked at her when she entered. On the counter, he'd left a cup by the coffeemaker, and she poured herself some. Breakfast was already on the table - scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. Theresa sat in the chair closest to him.</p>
<p>"I didn't know what you wanted for breakfast," he said, motioning toward the table.</p>
<p>"I'm not hungry, Garrett, if that's all right with you."</p>
<p>He smiled. "That's fine. I'm not that hungry, either."</p>
<p>She got up from her chair and went to him, sitting on his lap. She wrapped her arms around him and buried her face in his neck. He held her tightly in return, running his hands through her hair.</p>
<p>Finally, she pulled back. Their time in the sun this week had left her tanned. In her jeans shorts and clean white shirt, she looked like a carefree teenager. For a moment, she stared down at her sandals. Her suitcase and purse stood waiting next to the bedroom door.</p>
<p>"My plane leaves soon, and I've still got to check out of the hotel and return the rental car," she said.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?"</p>
<p>She nodded, her lips pursed. "No, I'll be rushing just to catch my flight, and besides, you'd have to follow me in your truck. We can say good-bye just as easily here."</p>
<p>"I'm going to call you tonight."</p>
<p>She smiled. "I was hoping you would."</p>
<p>Her eyes began to well with tears, and he pulled her close.</p>
<p>"I'm going to miss having you here," he said as she started to cry. He brushed away the tears with his fingers.</p>
<p>"And I'll miss having you cook for me," she whispered, feeling foolish.</p>
<p>He laughed, breaking the tension. "Don't be so sad. We're going to see each other again in a couple of weeks, aren't we?"</p>
<p>"Unless you're having second thoughts."</p>
<p>He smiled. "I'll be counting the days. And this time you're going to bring Kevin, right?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Good, I'd like to meet him. If he's anything at all like you, I'm sure we'll get along great."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you will, too."</p>
<p>"And until then, I'll be thinking about you all the time."</p>
<p>"You will?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. I'm already thinking about you."</p>
<p>"That's because I'm on your lap."</p>
<p>He laughed again, and she gave him a smile. Then she stood and wiped the wetness from her cheeks. Garrett moved to her suitcase and picked it up, and they both left the house.</p>
<p>Outside, the sun was already climbing in the sky, and it was warming up quickly. They walked to her rental car.</p>
<p>Theresa unlocked the trunk, and he placed her things inside. Then, taking her in his arms, he kissed her once gently and released her. After opening her car door, he helped her inside and she put the key in the ignition.</p>
<p>With the door open, they stared at each other until she started the car.</p>
<p>"I've got to go, if I'm going to catch my plane."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>He stepped back from the door and closed it. She rolled down the window and put her hand out. Garrett took it in his for just a moment.</p>
<p>"You'll call tonight?"</p>
<p>"I promise."</p>
<p>She pulled her hand in, smiling at him, and slowly started forward. Garrett watched her as she waved one last time before driving off, wondering how he'd get through the next two weeks.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Despite the traffic, Theresa got to the hotel quickly and checked out. There were three messages from Deanna. "What's going on down there? How did your date go?" read the first one; "Why didn't you call? I'm waiting to hear all about it," read the second; and the third said simply, "You're killing me! Call me with the details - please!" There was also one message from Kevin - she'd called him a couple of times from Garrett's house - and it was at least a couple of days old.</p>
<p>She returned the rental car and reached the airport with less than a half hour to spare. Luckily, she got to the gate just as they were boarding. After handing her ticket to the stewardess, she boarded the plane and took her seat. The flight to Charlotte was only partly full, and the seat next to her was vacant.</p>
<p>Theresa closed her eyes, thinking back on the amazing events of the past week. Garrett had stirred deep feelings in her, feelings she had long thought were buried.</p>
<p>She ran through their conversation of last night. His fears of letting go of the past, his feelings about not seeing her as much as he wanted to. These things she understood completely. But...</p>
<p>I think I'm in love with you.</p>
<p>She frowned. Why did he add the word "think"? Either he was in love or he wasn't... Had he said it to calm her down? Or had he said it for another reason?</p>
<p>I think I'm in love with you.</p>
<p>In her mind, she heard him say it over and over again; his voice was edged with... what? Ambivalence? Thinking about it now, she almost wished he'd said nothing at all. Then she wouldn't be trying to figure out exactly what he'd meant.</p>
<p>But what about her? Did she love Garrett?</p>
<p>She shut her eyes tiredly, suddenly unwilling to confront her warring emotions. One thing was for sure, though - she wasn't ever going to tell him that she loved him until she was certain he could put Catherine behind him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That night, in Garrett's dreams, a violent storm was well under way. Rain attacked the side of the house, and Garrett ran frantically from one room to the next. It was the house he lived in now, and though he knew exactly where he was going, the blinding rain coming in the open windows made it difficult to see. Knowing he had to close them, he rushed to the bedroom and the lights went off.</p>
<p>The room went black. Above the storm, he could hear the sound of a distant siren, warning of a hurricane. Lightning illuminated the sky as he struggled with the window. Rain continued to pour inward, wetting his hands and making it impossible to get the grip he needed.</p>
<p>Above him, the roof began to creak with the fury of the storm.</p>
<p>He continued to struggle with the window, but it didn't move. Finally giving up, he tried the window beside it. Like the first window, it was stuck as well.</p>
<p>He could hear the crash of shattering glass.</p>
<p>He turned and ran to the living room. The window there had exploded inward. Rain blew sideways into the room, and the wind was horrific. The front door was shaking in the frame</p>
<p>Outside the window, he heard Theresa begin to call for him.</p>
<p>"Garrett, you've got to get out now!"</p>
<p>At that moment, the bedroom windows crashed inward as well. The wind began to tear an opening in the ceiling. The house wouldn't be able to stand much longer.</p>
<p>Catherine.</p>
<p>He had to get her picture and the other items he kept in the end table.</p>
<p>"Garrett! You're running out of time!" Theresa shouted again.</p>
<p>Despite the rain and blackness, he could see her outside, motioning for him to follow her.</p>
<p>The picture. The ring. The Valentine's Day cards.</p>
<p>"Come on!" she continued to shout. Her arms were waving frantically.</p>
<p>With a roar, the roof separated from the frame of the house and the wind began to tear it away. On instinct, he raised his arms above his head just as part of the ceiling crashed down on him.</p>
<p>In moments, everything would be lost.</p>
<p>Not caring about the danger, he started toward the bedroom. He couldn't leave without them.</p>
<p>"You can still make it!"</p>
<p>Something in the sound of Theresa's cry made him stop. He glanced toward Theresa, then toward the bedroom, frozen.</p>
<p>More of the ceiling fell in around him.</p>
<p>He took a step toward the bedroom, and with that, he saw Theresa stop waving her arms. To him it seemed as if she'd suddenly given up.</p>
<p>The wind gusted through the room. Furniture toppled over throughout the room, blocking his path.</p>
<p>"Garrett! Please!" Theresa shouted.</p>
<p>Again, the sound of her voice made him stop, and with that, he realized that if he tried to save the things from his past, he might not make it out at all.</p>
<p>But was it worth it?</p>
<p>The answer was obvious.</p>
<p>He gave up his attempt and rushed toward the opening where the window had been. He stepped out onto the back deck just as the roof was completely torn away. As he jumped onto the deck, the walls crushed into a pile with a thunderous boom.</p>
<p>He looked for Theresa to make sure she was okay, but strangely, he couldn't see her anymore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER TEN</p>
<p>Early the next morning, Theresa was sleeping soundly when the sound of a ringing phone shook her awake. Fumbling for the phone, she recognized Garrett's voice instantly.</p>
<p>"Did you make it home okay?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I did," she replied sleepily. "What time is it?"</p>
<p>"A little after six. Did I wake you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I stayed up late last night waiting for your call. I started to wonder if you'd forgotten your promise."</p>
<p>"I didn't forget. I just figured you needed a little time to settle in."</p>
<p>"But you were confident I'd be up at the crack of dawn, right?"</p>
<p>Garrett laughed. "Sorry about that. How was the flight? How are you?"</p>
<p>"Good. Tired, but good."</p>
<p>"So I take it that the pace of the big city has already worn you out again."</p>
<p>She laughed, and Garrett's voice turned serious. "Hey, I want you to know something."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I miss you."</p>
<p>"You do?"</p>
<p>"Yeah - I went in to do work yesterday even though the shop was closed, hoping to get some paperwork done, but I couldn't do much because I kept thinking about you."</p>
<p>"That's good to hear."</p>
<p>"It's the truth. I don't know how I'm going to get any work done over the next couple of weeks."</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll manage."</p>
<p>"I might not be able to sleep, either."</p>
<p>She laughed, knowing he was teasing.</p>
<p>"Where are you now?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I'm sitting on the back deck, watching the sun come up. Why?"</p>
<p>Theresa thought about the view she was missing. "Is it beautiful?"</p>
<p>"It always is, but this morning, I'm not enjoying it as much as I usually do."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because you're not here with me to enjoy it."</p>
<p>She lay back on the bed, making herself comfortable. "Hey - I miss you, too."</p>
<p>"I hope so. I'd hate to think I was the only one who felt this way."</p>
<p>She smiled, holding the phone to her ear.</p>
<p>They said a reluctant good-bye twenty minutes later.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theresa entered the office later than usual. As always, the first place she went once she got to work was the break room for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>"Well, hello, Theresa," Deanna said happily, walking in behind her. "I thought you'd never get here. I've been dying to hear everything that happened."</p>
<p>"Good morning," Theresa mumbled, stirring her coffee. "Sorry I'm late."</p>
<p>"I'm just glad you made it at all."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for not calling, but I was a little worn out from my week," she said.</p>
<p>Deanna leaned against the counter. "Well, that's not a surprise. I've already put two and two together."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Deanna's eyes were bright. "I take it you haven't seen your desk yet."</p>
<p>"No, I just walked in. Why?"</p>
<p>"Well," she said, raising her eyebrows, "I guess you made a good impression."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about, Deanna?"</p>
<p>"Come with me," Deanna said with a conspiratorial grin as she led her back into the newsroom. When Theresa saw her desk, she gasped. There stood a dozen roses, beautifully arranged in a large clear vase.</p>
<p>"They arrived first thing this morning. I think the deliveryman was a little shocked that you weren't there to receive them, but I went ahead and said I was you. Then he really looked shocked."</p>
<p>Barely listening to what Deanna had said, Theresa reached for the card leaning against the vase and opened it immediately. It read:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>To the most beautiful woman I know - Now that I'm alone again, nothing is as it once was. The sky is grayer; the ocean is more forbidding. Will you make it right? The only way is to see me again.</p>
<p>I miss you,</p>
<p>Garrett</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Theresa smiled at the note and slipped it back inside the envelope, bending to smell the bouquet.</p>
<p>"I think you had a memorable week," Deanna said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I did," Theresa answered simply.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to hear about it - every spicy detail."</p>
<p>"I think," Theresa said, glancing around the newsroom at all the people watching her discreetly, "that I'd rather talk to you about it later, when we're alone. I don't need the whole office gossiping about it."</p>
<p>"They already are, Theresa. It's been a long time since flowers have been delivered here. But all right - we'll talk about it later."</p>
<p>"Did you tell them who they were from?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. To be honest, I like leaving them in suspense." She gave a small wink after looking around the newsroom. "Listen, Theresa, I've got some work to do. Do you think we could have lunch today? Then we can talk."</p>
<p>"Sure. Where?"</p>
<p>"How about Mikuni's? I bet you didn't find much sushi down in Wilmington."</p>
<p>"That sounds great. And Deanna... thanks for keeping it a secret."</p>
<p>"No problem."</p>
<p>Deanna patted Theresa's shoulder gently and headed back to her office. Theresa leaned over her desk and smelled the roses again before moving the vase to the corner of her desk. Soon, making sure that no one was paying attention, she picked up the phone and dialed Garrett at work.</p>
<p>Ian answered the phone. "Hold on, I think he's in his office. Who's calling, please?"</p>
<p>"Tell him it's someone who wants to schedule some dive lessons in a couple of weeks." She tried to sound as distant as she could, not sure if Ian knew about them.</p>
<p>Ian put her on hold, and there was silence for a short moment. Then the line clicked and Garrett came on.</p>
<p>"Can I help you?" he asked, sounding a little tired.</p>
<p>She said simply, "Thank you for the flowers."</p>
<p>His tone brightened. "Hey, it's you. I'm glad they arrived. Do they look okay?"</p>
<p>"They're beautiful. How did you know I loved roses?"</p>
<p>"I didn't, but I've never heard of a woman who didn't, so I took a chance."</p>
<p>She smiled. "So you send lots of women roses?"</p>
<p>"Millions. I have a lot of fans. Dive instructors are almost like movie stars, you know."</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>"Did anyone ask who they were from?" Garrett asked.</p>
<p>She smiled. "Of course."</p>
<p>"I hope you said good things."</p>
<p>"I did. I told them you were sixty-eight and fat, with a horrible lisp that made it impossible to understand you. But since you were so pitiful, I went ahead and had lunch with you."</p>
<p>"Hey, that hurts," he said. He paused. "So... I hope the roses will remind you that I'm thinking about you."</p>
<p>"They might," she said shyly.</p>
<p>"Well, I am thinking about you and I don't want you to forget it."</p>
<p>She glanced at the roses. "Ditto," she said quietly.</p>
<p>After they had hung up, Theresa sat quietly for a moment, reaching for the card again. She read it once more, and this time, instead of putting it back with the flowers, she placed it in her purse for safekeeping. Knowing this crowd, she was sure someone would read it when she wasn't looking.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"So, what's he like?"</p>
<p>Deanna sat across from Theresa at the table in the restaurant. Theresa handed Deanna the pictures from her vacation.</p>
<p>"I don't know where to start."</p>
<p>Staring at a picture of Garrett and Theresa on the beach, Deanna spoke without looking at her.</p>
<p>"Start at the beginning. I don't want to miss a thing."</p>
<p>Since Theresa had already told her about meeting Garrett at the docks, she picked up her story from the evening they spent sailing. She left very little out as Deanna listened with great attention.</p>
<p>"It sounds like you had a wonderful time," Deanna said, smiling like a proud mother.</p>
<p>"I did. It was one of the best weeks I've ever spent. It's just that..."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for her to answer. "Well, Garrett said something toward the end that got me wondering where this whole thing was going to go from here."</p>
<p>"What did he say?"</p>
<p>"It wasn't just what he said, but how he said it. He sounded as if he weren't sure he wanted us to see each other again."</p>
<p>"I thought you said that you were going down to Wilmington again in a couple of weeks."</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>"Then what's the problem?"</p>
<p>She fidgeted, trying to collect her thoughts. "Well, he's still struggling with Catherine and... and I'm not exactly sure whether he'll ever get over it."</p>
<p>Deanna laughed suddenly.</p>
<p>"What's so funny?" Theresa asked, startled.</p>
<p>"You are, Theresa. What did you expect? You knew he was still struggling with Catherine before you went down there. Did you think that he'd completely get over Catherine in a couple of days, just because you two hit it off so well?"</p>
<p>Theresa looked sheepish and Deanna laughed again.</p>
<p>"You did, didn't you? That's exactly what you thought."</p>
<p>"Deanna, you weren't there... You don't know how right everything seemed between us, up until the last night."</p>
<p>Deanna's voice softened. "Theresa, I know there's a part of you that believes you can change someone, but the reality is that you can't. You can change yourself, and Garrett can change himself, but you can't do it for him."</p>
<p>"I know that -"</p>
<p>"But you don't," Deanna said gently. "Or if you do, you don't want to see it that way. Your vision, as they say, has become clouded."</p>
<p>Theresa thought for a moment about what she'd said.</p>
<p>"Let's take an objective look at what happened with Garrett, shall we?" Deanna asked.</p>
<p>Theresa nodded.</p>
<p>"Though you knew something about Garrett, he knew absolutely nothing about you. Yet he was the one who asked you to go sailing. So something between you two clicked right away. Next, you see him again when you pick up your jacket, and he asks you to lunch. He tells you about Catherine and then asks you to come over for dinner. After that, you spend four wonderful days together. And now, you two are planning to see each other again. To me, it sounds like the whole thing was a smashing success."</p>
<p>"Then, you mean I shouldn't worry about whether he'll ever get over Catherine?"</p>
<p>Deanna shook her head. "Not exactly. But look - you've got to take this one step at a time. The fact is, you only spent a few days together so far - that's not enough time to make a decision about something like this. If I were you, I'd see how you both feel over the next couple of weeks, and when you see him the next time, you will know a lot more than you know now."</p>
<p>"Do you think so?" Theresa asked worriedly.</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>While Theresa and Deanna were eating, Garrett was working in his office behind a giant stack of papers when the door opened. Jeb Blake entered, making sure that his son was alone before closing the door behind him. After taking a seat in the chair across from Garrett's desk, Jeb pulled some tobacco and rolling paper from his pocket and began to roll his cigarette.</p>
<p>"Go ahead and sit down. As you can see, I don't have much to do." Garrett gestured toward the pile.</p>
<p>Jeb smiled and continued rolling. "I called the shop a couple of times and they said you hadn't come in all week. What were you doing?"</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair, Garrett eyed his father. "I'm sure you already know the answer to your question, and that's probably the reason you're here."</p>
<p>"You were with Theresa the whole time?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was."</p>
<p>Continuing to roll his cigarette, Jeb asked nonchalantly, "So, what did you two do with yourselves?"</p>
<p>"We went sailing, walked on the beach, talked... You know, just got to know each other."</p>
<p>Jeb finished with his cigarette and put it in his mouth. He pulled a Zippo lighter from his front shirt pocket, lit up, and inhaled deeply. Exhaling, he gave Garrett a grin.</p>
<p>"Did you cook those steaks like I taught you?"</p>
<p>Garrett smiled. "Of course."</p>
<p>"Was she impressed?"</p>
<p>"She was very impressed."</p>
<p>Jeb nodded and took another drag from his cigarette. Garrett could feel the air in the office beginning to grow stale.</p>
<p>"Well then, she has at least one good quality, doesn't she?"</p>
<p>"She's got a lot more than one, Dad."</p>
<p>"You liked her, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Very much."</p>
<p>"Even though you don't know her very well?"</p>
<p>"I feel like I know everything about her."</p>
<p>Jeb nodded and said nothing for a moment. Finally, he asked, "Are you going to see her again?"</p>
<p>"Actually, she's coming down in a couple of weeks with her son."</p>
<p>Jeb watched Garrett's expression carefully. Then, standing, he started toward the door. Before opening it, he turned and faced his son. "Garrett, can I give you some advice?"</p>
<p>Startled at his father's abrupt departure, he answered, "Sure."</p>
<p>"If you like her, if she makes you happy, and if you feel like you know her - then don't let her go."</p>
<p>"Why are you telling me this?"</p>
<p>Jeb looked directly at Garrett and took another drag on his cigarette. "Because if I know you, you're going to be the one who ends it, and I'm here to try to stop you if I can."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"You know exactly what I'm talking about," he said quietly. Turning around, Jeb opened the door and left Garrett's office without another word.</p>
<p>Later that night, with the remnants of his father's comments rolling through his head, Garrett couldn't sleep. He rose from his bed and went to the kitchen, knowing what needed to be done. In the drawer, he found the stationery he always used when his mind was conflicted, and he sat down with the hopes of putting his thoughts into words.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>My darling Catherine,</p>
<p>I don't know what's happening to me, and I don't know if I ever will. So much has happened lately that I can't make sense of what I'm going through.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Garrett sat at the table for an hour after writing those first two lines, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't think of anything else to say. But when he woke the following morning, unlike most days, his first thought wasn't about Catherine.</p>
<p>Instead, it was about Theresa.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, Garrett and Theresa spoke on the phone every night, sometimes for hours. Garrett also sent a couple of letters - short notes, really - to let her know that he missed her, and she got another dozen roses the following week, this time with a box of candy.</p>
<p>Theresa sent him a light blue shirt she thought would look good with his jeans, along with a couple of cards.</p>
<p>Kevin arrived home a few days later, and it made the next week pass much more quickly for Theresa than for Garrett. His first night home, Kevin ate dinner with Theresa, telling her about his vacation and then collapsed into a deep sleep for almost fifteen hours. When he woke, there was already a long list of things that needed to be done. He needed new clothes for school - he'd already outgrown most of what he'd worn the previous year - and he had to sign up for fall league soccer, which ended up taking almost an entire Saturday. In addition, he had a Tuesday afternoon appointment with the orthodontist to see if he needed braces.</p>
<p>In other words, life was back to normal.</p>
<p>On Kevin's second night back, Theresa told him about her vacation at the Cape, then about her trip to Wilmington. She mentioned Garrett, trying to convey how she felt about him without alarming Kevin. At first, when she explained how they were going to visit him the following weekend, Kevin didn't sound so sure about it. But after she told him what Garrett did for a living, Kevin began to show some signs of interest.</p>
<p>"You mean he might teach me how to scuba dive?" he asked as she was vacuuming the house.</p>
<p>"He said that he would, if you wanted to."</p>
<p>"Cool," Kevin said.</p>
<p>A few nights later, she took him to the store to get him a few magazines about diving. By the time they were ready to leave, Kevin knew the name of every piece of equipment it was possible to own, obviously dreaming about his upcoming adventure.</p>
<p>Garrett, meanwhile, plunged ahead with work. When he mentioned to his father how much he missed Theresa, his father only nodded and smiled. Something in his father's assessing gaze made Garrett wonder what exactly was going through the old man's mind.</p>
<p>By prior agreement, both Theresa and Garrett had decided it would be best if she and Kevin didn't stay at Garrett's house, but because it was still summer, nearly every room in town was booked. Luckily, Garrett knew the owner of a small motel a mile up the beach from Garrett's house, and he had been able to make arrangements for their stay.</p>
<p>When the day finally came for Theresa and Kevin to visit, Garrett bought some groceries, washed his truck, and showered before heading to the airport.</p>
<p>Dressed in khaki pants and the shirt that Theresa had bought him, he waited nervously at the gate.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, his feelings for Theresa had grown. He knew now that whatever happened between him and Theresa wasn't based simply on physical attraction - his longing hinted at something much deeper, more lasting. It had been so long since he'd felt this way about anyone - and where was it all going?</p>
<p>When Theresa stepped off the plane with Kevin beside her, all his nervousness suddenly faded away. She was beautiful - more so than he remembered. And Kevin - he looked exactly like his picture and a lot like his mother. He was a little over five feet, with Theresa's dark hair and eyes.</p>
<p>When Theresa saw him she waved, and Garrett moved toward them, reaching for their carry-on bags. Not sure whether he should kiss her in front of Kevin, he hesitated until Theresa leaned over and gaily kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p>"Garrett, I'd like you to meet my son, Kevin," she said proudly.</p>
<p>"Hi, Kevin."</p>
<p>"Hi, Mr. Blake," he said stiffly, as if Garrett were his teacher.</p>
<p>"Call me Garrett," he said, holding out his hand. Kevin shook it, a little unsure. Until this point, no adult had said that he could use his first name.</p>
<p>"How was your flight?" Garrett asked.</p>
<p>"Good," Theresa responded.</p>
<p>"Did you get anything to eat?"</p>
<p>"Not yet."</p>
<p>"Well, how about we grab a bite before I take you to your motel?"</p>
<p>"Sounds good."</p>
<p>"Do you want anything in particular?" Garrett asked Kevin.</p>
<p>"I like McDonald's."</p>
<p>"Oh, honey, no," Theresa said quickly, but Garrett stopped her with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>"McDonald's is fine with me."</p>
<p>"You sure?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>"Positive. I eat there all the time."</p>
<p>Kevin looked delighted at his answer, and the three of them started walking toward the baggage claim area. As they left the gates. Garrett asked:</p>
<p>"Are you a good swimmer, Kevin?"</p>
<p>"Pretty good."</p>
<p>"Are you ready for some scuba lessons this weekend?"</p>
<p>"I think so - I've been reading up on it," he said, trying to sound older than he was.</p>
<p>"Well, good. I was hoping you'd say that. If we're lucky, we may even be able to get you certified before you head back."</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"It's a license that allows you to dive whenever you want - like a driver's license."</p>
<p>"You can do that in a few days?"</p>
<p>"Sure. You're required to take a written test and spend a few hours in the water with an instructor. But since you'll be my only student this weekend - unless your mother wants to learn, too - we should have more than enough time."</p>
<p>"Cool," Kevin said. He turned toward Theresa. "Are you going to learn, too, Mom?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Maybe."</p>
<p>"I think you should," Kevin said. "It would be fun."</p>
<p>"He's right - you should learn, too," Garrett added with a smile, knowing she would feel cornered by the two of them and probably give in.</p>
<p>"Fine," she said, "I'll go, too. But if I see any sharks, I'm quitting."</p>
<p>"You mean there might be sharks?" Kevin asked quickly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we'll probably see some sharks. But they're little and they don't bother people."</p>
<p>"How little?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>"Little enough that you won't have anything to worry about."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Positive."</p>
<p>"Cool," Kevin repeated to himself, and Theresa glanced at Garrett, wondering if he was telling the truth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After picking up their bags and stopping for a bite to eat, Garrett drove Theresa and Kevin to the motel. Once their things were inside, Garrett went back to his truck, returning with a book and some papers under his arms.</p>
<p>"Kevin - these are for you."</p>
<p>"What are they?"</p>
<p>"It's the book and the tests you need to read for your certification. If you want to head out tomorrow, you have to read the first two sections and complete the first test."</p>
<p>"Is it hard?"</p>
<p>"No - it's pretty easy, but you still have to do it. And you can use the book to find the answers you're not sure about."</p>
<p>"You mean I can look up the answers while I take the test?"</p>
<p>Garrett nodded. "Yeah. When I give these to my classes, they're supposed to do them at home and I'm sure almost everyone uses the book. The important thing is that you try to learn what you need to know. Diving is a lot of fun, but it can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing."</p>
<p>Garrett handed Kevin the book as he went on.</p>
<p>"If you can finish by tomorrow, we'll head to the pool for the first part of your certification. You'll learn how to put on your equipment and then we'll practice for a while."</p>
<p>"We're not going in the ocean?"</p>
<p>"Not tomorrow - you have to spend some time getting comfortable with the equipment first. After we spend a few hours doing that, then we'll be ready. We'll probably hit the ocean on Monday and Tuesday for your first open-water dives. And if you get enough hours in the water, you'll have a temporary certification by the time you step on the plane to go home. Then, all you have to do is mail an application, and you'll get the actual certification in the mail in a couple of weeks."</p>
<p>Kevin began to flip through the pages. "Does Mom have to do it, too?"</p>
<p>"If she wants to be certified, she does."</p>
<p>Theresa walked over, peeking over Kevin's shoulder as he glanced through the book. The information didn't look too discouraging.</p>
<p>"Kevin," she said, "we can do it together tomorrow morning, if you're too tired to start now."</p>
<p>"I'm not too tired," he said quickly.</p>
<p>"Then would you mind if Garrett and I talked on the patio for a while?"</p>
<p>"No, go ahead," he said absently, already turning to the first page.</p>
<p>Once outside, Garrett and Theresa sat across from each other. Glancing back at her son, Theresa saw that Kevin was already reading.</p>
<p>"I appreciate your doing this for him," she said.</p>
<p>"Hey - you forget this is what I do for a living." After making sure that Kevin was still reading, he scooted his chair a little closer. "I missed you these last couple of weeks," he said quietly, taking her hand in his.</p>
<p>"I missed you, too."</p>
<p>"You look wonderful," he added. "You were easily the prettiest woman who got off the plane."</p>
<p>Despite herself, Theresa blushed.</p>
<p>"Are you disappointed that we're not staying at your place?"</p>
<p>"Not really. I understand your reasons - Kevin doesn't know me from Adam. And, like you said, he's been through enough already."</p>
<p>"You know that it means we won't be able to spend much time alone this weekend, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I'll take you any way I can get you," he said.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Three hours later, long after Kevin was asleep, Theresa quietly led Garrett to the door. After stepping out into the hall and closing the door behind them, they kissed for a long time, both of them finding it hard to let each other go. In his arms Theresa felt like a teenager again, as she were sneaking a kiss on her parents' porch, and it somehow added to the excitement she was feeling.</p>
<p>"I wish you could stay here tonight," she whispered.</p>
<p>"I do, too."</p>
<p>"Is it as difficult for you to say good night as it is for me?"</p>
<p>"I'd be willing to bet it's a lot more difficult for me. I'm going home to an empty house."</p>
<p>"Don't say that. You'll make me feel guilty."</p>
<p>"Maybe a little guilt is a good thing. It lets me know you care."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be down here if I didn't." They kissed again, hungrily.</p>
<p>Pulling back, he mumbled, "I should really be going." He didn't sound as if he meant it.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"But I don't want to," he said with a boyish smile.</p>
<p>"Go home, Garrett," she said shyly. "And will you do me a favor?"</p>
<p>"Anything."</p>
<p>"Dream about me, okay?"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Kevin woke early the next morning and opened the curtains. "Mom - you've got to take the test before we go," he said excitedly.</p>
<p>Theresa groaned. Turning over, she checked the clock. A little after six A.M. She'd been in bed less than five hours.</p>
<p>"It's too early," she said, closing her eyes again. "Can you give me a few more minutes, honey?"</p>
<p>"We don't have time." he said, sitting on her bed and nudging her shoulder gently. "You haven't even read the first section yet."</p>
<p>"Did you finish it all last night?"</p>
<p>"Yep," he said. "My test is over there, but don't copy, okay? I don't want to get into trouble."</p>
<p>"I don't think you'd get in trouble," she said sleepily. "We know the teacher, you know."</p>
<p>"But it wouldn't be fair. And besides, you have to know this stuff, just like Mr. Blake... I mean Garrett... said, otherwise you could run into trouble."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," she said, sitting up slowly.</p>
<p>Luckily, Garrett had been right when he'd told her that the information wasn't difficult. It was easy reading with pictures describing the equipment, and she was finished by the time Kevin was dressed.</p>
<p>Soon she finished with her test. She took a long, hot shower and dressed, putting on her swimsuit beneath her clothes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Garrett knocked at the front door of their motel room promptly at nine, and Kevin raced to the door to answer it.</p>
<p>"Are you two ready?" he asked.</p>
<p>"We sure are," Kevin answered quickly. "My test is over there. Let me get it for you."</p>
<p>He skipped over to the table as Theresa rose from the bed and gave Garrett a quick kiss good morning.</p>
<p>"How was your morning?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It already seems like afternoon. Kevin got me up at the crack of dawn to take the test."</p>
<p>Garrett smiled as Kevin returned with his test.</p>
<p>"Here it is, Mr. Blake. Garrett, I mean."</p>
<p>Garrett took it and began to look through his answers.</p>
<p>"My mom had some trouble with a couple of questions, but I helped her out," Kevin went on, and Theresa rolled her eyes. "Ready to go, Mom?"</p>
<p>"Whenever you are," she said, picking up the room key and her purse.</p>
<p>"Then come on," Kevin said, leading the way down the hall, toward Garrett's truck.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Throughout the morning and early afternoon, Garrett taught them the basics of scuba diving. They learned how the equipment worked, how to put it on and test it, and finally how to breathe through the mouthpiece, first on the side of the pool, then underwater.</p>
<p>After a few hours in the water, both Kevin and Theresa were tired. They had lunch, and once again, Garrett told his diving stories, this time for Kevin. Kevin asked a hundred questions. Garrett answered each one patiently, and Theresa was relieved at how well they got along.</p>
<p>After stopping at the motel to pick up the book and the lesson for the following day, Garrett brought them both to his house. Though Kevin had planned to start the next few chapters right away, the fact that Garrett lived on the beach changed everything. Standing in the living room and looking toward the ocean, he asked:</p>
<p>"Can I go down to the water, Mom?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," she said gently. "We've just spent all day in the pool."</p>
<p>"Ah, Mom... please? You don't have to go with me - you can watch me from the deck."</p>
<p>"All right, you can go. But don't go out too deep, okay?"</p>
<p>"I won't, I promise," he said excitedly. After seizing the towel Garrett handed him, he ran down to the water. Garrett and Theresa sat on the deck and watched him as he began to splash around.</p>
<p>"I think he likes you," Theresa said. "At lunch when you went to the bathroom, he said you were cool."</p>
<p>Garrett smiled. "I'm glad. I like him, too. He's a good student."</p>
<p>"You're just saying that to please me."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not. He really is. I meet many young kids in my classes, and he's very mature and well-spoken for his age. And he's nice, too. Too many kids are spoiled these days, but I don't get that sense about him."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"I mean it, Theresa. After hearing about your worries, I wasn't sure what to expect. But he's really a great kid. You've done a good job raising him."</p>
<p>She reached for his hand and kissed it gently. She spoke quietly.</p>
<p>"It means a lot to me to hear you say that. I haven't met many men who want to talk about him, let alone spend time with him."</p>
<p>"Then it's their loss."</p>
<p>She smiled. "Why do you always know exactly what to say to make me feel good?"</p>
<p>"Maybe it's because you bring out the best in me."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That evening Garrett took Kevin to the video store to pick up a couple of movies he wanted to watch and ordered pizza for the three of them. They watched the first movie together, eating in the living room. After dinner, Kevin slowly began to fade. By nine o'clock, he'd fallen asleep in front of the television. Theresa pushed him gently, telling him it was time to leave.</p>
<p>"Can't we just sleep here tonight?" he mumbled, only half-conscious.</p>
<p>"I think we should go," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"If you want, you two can sleep in my bed," Garrett offered. "I'll stay out here and sleep on the couch."</p>
<p>"Let's do that, Mom. I'm really tired."</p>
<p>"I don't think he's giving you much choice," Garrett whispered.</p>
<p>"Well, maybe one night wouldn't hurt," she surrendered, and Garrett winked.</p>
<p>"I was hoping you'd say that."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Instead of watching the second movie, Garrett and Theresa sat on the couch, sipping wine and talking. Theresa checked on Kevin a couple of times, making sure he was still asleep. He looked as if he hadn't moved at all.</p>
<p>By midnight, Theresa was yawning steadily, and Garrett suggested that she get some sleep.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, really," she said before yawning again. Garrett rose and went to the closet. He pulled out a sheet, blanket, and pillow and brought them to the couch.</p>
<p>"I insist. Try to get some sleep. We have the next few days to see each other."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Positive."</p>
<p>She helped Garrett get the couch ready and went to the bedroom. "If you don't want to sleep in your clothes, there are some sweats in the second drawer," he said.</p>
<p>She kissed him again. "I had a wonderful day today," she said.</p>
<p>"So did I."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few hours later Garrett woke to the sensation of someone touching him. Opening his eyes, he saw Theresa sitting next to him. She was wearing the sweats he'd mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" he asked, sitting up.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," she whispered, stroking his arm.</p>
<p>"What time is it?"</p>
<p>"A little after three."</p>
<p>"Is Kevin still sleeping?"</p>
<p>"Like a rock."</p>
<p>"Can I ask why you got out of bed?"</p>
<p>"I had a dream and I couldn't fall back to sleep."</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes. "What was the dream about?"</p>
<p>"You," she said.</p>
<p>"Was it a good dream?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes..." She leaned over to kiss his chest, and Garrett pulled her closer. He glanced toward the bedroom door. She had closed it behind her.</p>
<p>"Aren't you worried about Kevin?" he asked.</p>
<p>"A little, but I'm going to trust you to be as quiet as possible."</p>
<p>They made love tenderly, quietly, and afterward they lay beside each other. For a long time, neither of them spoke. When the faintest hint of light began to brush the horizon, they kissed good night and she returned to the bedroom. Within a few minutes, she was sleeping soundly, and Garrett watched her from the doorway.</p>
<p>For some reason, he found it impossible to fall asleep again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The following morning, Theresa and Kevin did the workbook together while Garrett ran off to pick up some fresh bagels for breakfast. Again, they headed off to the pool. This time the lessons were a little more advanced, covering a number of different skills.</p>
<p>They also spent time in the deep end of the pool, swimming underwater for extended periods. Predictably, both of them were tired after a few hours and ready to call it a day.</p>
<p>"Will we go into the ocean tomorrow?" Kevin asked as they were walking back to the truck.</p>
<p>"If you'd like to. I think you're ready."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm ready."</p>
<p>"How about you, Theresa? Are you ready for the ocean?"</p>
<p>"If Kevin's ready, then I'm ready."</p>
<p>"Am I still going to get certified by Tuesday?" Kevin asked.</p>
<p>"If the ocean dives go well, you both will."</p>
<p>"Awesome."</p>
<p>"What's up for the rest of the day?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>Garrett started loading the tanks in the back of the truck. "I thought we'd go sailing. It looks like it's going to be great weather."</p>
<p>"Can I learn how to do that, too?" Kevin asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"Sure. I'll make you my first mate."</p>
<p>Kevin looked at Theresa with wide eyes, and she could almost read his thoughts. First, I learn how to dive, and then I become a first mate. Wait until I tell my friends.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The three of them had a wonderful time on the water. Garrett taught Kevin the basics of sailing. As on their first date together, they had sandwiches and salads.</p>
<p>It was late by the time they made it back to the docks, and after Garrett showed Kevin how to close up the boat to protect it from unexpected storms, Garrett brought them back to their motel. Since all three of them were exhausted, Theresa and Garrett said good-bye quickly, and both Theresa and Kevin were in bed by the time Garrett arrived back at his house.</p>
<p>The following day, Garrett took them out for their first ocean dive. Thanks to the calm, coastal weather, the water was clear, with excellent visibility. Garrett took a few photos of them as they explored one of the shallow-water wrecks off the North Carolina coast.</p>
<p>They spent the evening at Garrett's house again. After Kevin fell asleep, Garrett and Theresa sat close to each other on the deck, caressed by the warm, humid air.</p>
<p>"I can't believe we'll be leaving tomorrow night," Theresa said with a trace of sadness in her voice. "These last couple of days have flown by."</p>
<p>"That's because we've been so busy."</p>
<p>She smiled. "Now you have a sense of what my life is like in Boston."</p>
<p>"Always racing around?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "Exactly. Kevin is the best thing that ever happened to me, but he sometimes wears me out."</p>
<p>"He's a great kid - I've really enjoyed spending time with him."</p>
<p>"I'm so glad. I know he feels the same way." She paused "You know, even though we haven't spent much time alone on this trip, it seems like I know you a lot better now than when I first came down here by myself."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? I'm still the same guy I was before."</p>
<p>She smiled. "We both know it's easier to get involved with someone when you can spend a lot of exclusive time together. This time, you saw what it would really be like with Kevin around... and yet you handled the whole thing really fine."</p>
<p>"Well, thanks, but it wasn't that hard. As long as you're around, it doesn't matter what we do. I just like spending time with you."</p>
<p>He put his arm around her, pulling her close. She rested her head on his shoulder. In the silence, they listened as the waves rolled up along the beach.</p>
<p>"Are you going to stay over again tonight?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I was giving it some serious consideration."</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. "Are you flirting with me?"</p>
<p>"I'm trying," she confessed, and he laughed. "You know, Garrett, I really feel comfortable around you."</p>
<p>"Comfortable? You make it sound like I'm a couch."</p>
<p>"I don't mean it like that. I mean I just feel good about myself when we're together."</p>
<p>"You should. I feel pretty good about you."</p>
<p>"Pretty good? That's it?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "No, that's not all." He looked almost shy for a second. "After you left the last time, my dad came in and lectured me."</p>
<p>"What did he say?"</p>
<p>"He said that if you made me happy, that I shouldn't let you go."</p>
<p>"And how do you intend to do that?"</p>
<p>"I guess I'll have to bowl you over with my charisma."</p>
<p>"You've already done that."</p>
<p>He glanced at her, and then looked out over the water. After a moment, he spoke quietly. "Then I guess I'll have to tell you that I love you."</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Overhead, the stars were out in full, twinkling in the darkened sky. Theresa listened as the words rolled through her head again.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>No ambivalence this time, no doubt about what he'd said.</p>
<p>"Do you really?" she whispered finally.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, turning to face her, "I do." When he answered, she saw something in his eyes she hadn't seen before.</p>
<p>"Oh Garrett," she began uncertainly, before Garrett interrupted her with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>"Theresa, I don't expect you to feel the same way. I just wanted you to know how I feel." He thought for a moment and found himself remembering the dream he'd had. "Over the last two weeks, a lot of things have happened..." He paused.</p>
<p>She started to say something, but Garrett shook his head. It took a moment for him to continue.</p>
<p>"And I'm not sure I understand everything, but I really know how I feel about you."</p>
<p>His finger gently moved across her cheek and lips. "I love you, Theresa."</p>
<p>"I love you, too," she said softly, trying out the words and hoping they were true.</p>
<p>They held each other for a long time afterward, and then went inside and made love, whispering to each other until the early morning hours. But this time, after Theresa went to the bedroom, Garrett slept soundly while Theresa stayed awake, thinking about the miracle that had brought them together.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day passed wonderfully. Whenever they had a chance, Garrett and Theresa held hands, stealing a few kisses when Kevin wasn't looking.</p>
<p>They spent their day practicing as they had before, and once they had finished their final diving lesson, Garrett gave them their temporary certificates right on the boat. "You can dive whenever and wherever you want now," he said to Kevin, who handled the certificate almost as if it were gold. "Just send this form in and you'll have your PADI certificate in a couple of weeks. But remember - it's never safe to dive alone. Always go with someone else."</p>
<p>Since it was their last day in Wilmington, Theresa checked them out of the motel, and the three of them went to Garrett's house. Kevin wanted to spend their last few hours on the beach, and Theresa and Garrett sat with him near the water's edge.</p>
<p>They had a quick dinner on the back deck - hot dogs on the grill - before Garrett drove them to the airport. After Theresa and Kevin had safely boarded, Garrett stayed a few minutes, watching until the plane finally began to back out of the gate. When it drew out of sight, he walked back to the truck and returned home, already watching the clock to see how long it would be until he could call her that evening.</p>
<p>In their seats, Theresa and Kevin thumbed through magazines. Then Kevin suddenly turned to her and asked:</p>
<p>"Mom, do you like Garrett?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. But more important, do you like him?"</p>
<p>"I think he's cool. For a grownup, I mean."</p>
<p>Theresa smiled. "Are you glad we came?"</p>
<p>He nodded. "Yeah, I'm glad." He paused, fidgeting with the magazine. "Mom, can I ask you something?"</p>
<p>"Anything."</p>
<p>"Are you going to marry Garrett?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Why?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to?"</p>
<p>It took her a few moments to answer. "I'm not sure. I know that I don't want to marry him right now. We're still getting to know each other."</p>
<p>"But you might want to marry him in the future?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>Kevin looked relieved. "I'm glad. You seemed like you were really happy when you were with him."</p>
<p>"Could you tell?"</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm twelve. I know more than you think."</p>
<p>She reached over and touched his hand. "Well, what if I'd told you I wanted to marry him now?"</p>
<p>He was quiet for a moment. "I guess I'd wonder where we were going to live."</p>
<p>Theresa couldn't think of a good response. Where indeed?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
<p>Four days after Theresa left Wilmington, Garrett had another dream, only this time it was about Catherine. In the dream, they were in a grassy field bordered by a cliff overlooking the ocean. They were walking together, holding hands and talking, when Garrett said something that made her laugh. All at once, she broke away from him. Looking over her shoulder and laughing, she called for Garrett to chase her. He did, laughing as well, feeling much as he had the day they were married.</p>
<p>"Chase me, Garrett. Can you catch me?" she called.</p>
<p>Suddenly he noticed that she was heading toward the cliff. In her excitement and joy, she didn't realize where she was going.</p>
<p>But that's ridiculous, he thought. She has to know.</p>
<p>Garrett called for her to stop, but instead she began to run faster.</p>
<p>She was approaching the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>With a feeling of certain dread, he saw that he was still too far behind her to catch her.</p>
<p>"Stop!" he screamed again. The panic he felt then was greater than anything he'd ever known. With everything he had, he willed his legs to move faster, but they began to tire, turning heavier with every step he took.</p>
<p>Then, just as suddenly as she had broken away, she stopped and turned to him.</p>
<p>She stood only inches from the edge.</p>
<p>"Don't move," he shouted, but it came out in a whisper. He stopped a few feet from her and held out his hand, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>"Come toward me," he pleaded. "You're right on the edge."</p>
<p>She smiled and glanced behind her. Noticing how close she was to falling, she turned toward him.</p>
<p>"Did you think you were going to lose me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said quietly, "and I promise not to ever let it happen again."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Garrett woke and sat up in bed, staying awake for several hours afterward. Finally, he got up. Still exhausted and feeling depressed, he found it impossible to think about anything but the dream. Not knowing what to do, he called his father, who met him for breakfast in their usual place.</p>
<p>"I don't know why I feel this way," he told his father after a few minutes of small talk. "I just don't understand it."</p>
<p>His father didn't answer. Instead he watched his son over his coffee cup, remaining silent as his son went on.</p>
<p>"It's not like she did anything to upset me," he continued. "We just spent a long weekend together, and I really care for her. I met her son, too. and he's great. It's just that... I don't know I don't know if I'm going to be able to keep this up."</p>
<p>Garrett paused.</p>
<p>"Keep what up?" Jeb Blake finally asked.</p>
<p>Garrett stirred his coffee absently. "I don't know whether I can see her again."</p>
<p>His father cocked an eyebrow but didn't reply. Garrett went on.</p>
<p>"I mean, she doesn't live here. She's a thousand miles away, she's got her own life, and she's got her own interests. And here I am, living down here and leading an entirely separate life. Maybe she'd do better with someone else, someone she could see on a regular basis."</p>
<p>He thought about what he'd said, knowing that he didn't quite believe himself. Still, he didn't want to tell his father about the dream.</p>
<p>"I mean, how can we build a relationship if we don't see each other very often?"</p>
<p>Again, his father said nothing. Garrett carried on, as if talking to himself.</p>
<p>"If she lived here and I could see her every day, I think I'd feel differently..."</p>
<p>He trailed off, trying to make sense of his thoughts. After a while, he spoke again.</p>
<p>"I just don't see how we can make it work. I've thought about it a lot, and I don't see how it could be possible. I don't want to move to Boston, and I'm sure she doesn't want to move here, so where would that leave us?"</p>
<p>Garrett stopped and waited for his father to say something - anything - in response to what he'd said up to that point. But for a while, he didn't make a sound. Finally, he sighed and looked away.</p>
<p>"It sounds to me like you're making excuses," Jeb said quietly. "You're trying to convince yourself, and you're using me to listen to yourself talk."</p>
<p>"No, Dad, I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out this whole thing."</p>
<p>"Who do you think you're talking to, Garrett?" Jeb Blake shook his head. "I know exactly what you're going through. You've been alone so long that you're afraid of what might happen if you actually find someone else that can take you away from it."</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid," Garrett protested.</p>
<p>His father cut him off sharply. "You can't even admit it to yourself, can you?"</p>
<p>The disappointment in his tone was unmistakable. "You know, Garrett, when your mom died, I made excuses, too. Over the years, I told myself all sorts of things. And you want to know where it got me?"</p>
<p>He stared at his son. "I'm old and tired, and most of all, I'm alone. If I could go back in time, I'd change a lot about myself, and I'll be damned if I'm going to let you do the same things I did."</p>
<p>Jeb paused before going on, and his tone softened. "I was wrong, Garrett. I was wrong not to try to find someone else. I was wrong to feel guilty about your mom. I was wrong to keep living my life the way I did, always suffering inside. Because you know what? I think your mom would have wanted me to find someone else. Your mom would have wanted me to be happy. And you know why?"</p>
<p>Garrett didn't answer.</p>
<p>"Because she loved me. And if you think that you're showing your love to Catherine by suffering the way you've been doing, then somewhere along the way, I made a mistake in raising you."</p>
<p>"You didn't make a mistake."</p>
<p>"I think I did. Because when I look at you, I see myself, and to be honest, I'd rather see someone different. I'd like to see someone who learned that it's okay to go on, that it's okay to find someone who can make you happy. But right now, it's like I'm looking in the mirror and seeing myself twenty years ago."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As the days passed, the image of the dream began to fade. Each time Garrett talked to Theresa, he found himself feeling a little more renewed. He also spoke to Kevin a couple of times, and his enthusiasm for Garrett's presence in their lives helped him regain his balance as well. He kept himself as busy as he could, doing his best not to think about the complexities of his new situation. Besides, Theresa had invited him to visit her in Boston while Kevin was at soccer camp.</p>
<p>Two weeks later - a few days before he was leaving for Boston - Garrett was cooking in the kitchen when the phone rang.</p>
<p>"Hi," she said. "Got a few minutes?"</p>
<p>"I always have a few minutes to talk when it comes to you."</p>
<p>"I was just calling to find out what time your flight is coming in. You weren't sure the last time we talked."</p>
<p>"Hold on," he said, looking for his ticket. "Here it is - I'll be getting into Boston a few minutes after one."</p>
<p>"That's perfect. I've got to see Kevin off a few hours earlier, and it'll give me time to get the apartment in shape."</p>
<p>"Cleaning up for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm even going to dust."</p>
<p>"I feel honored."</p>
<p>"You should. Only you and my parents get that kind of attention."</p>
<p>He laughed. "I'm looking forward to seeing you again," he said earnestly. "These last three weeks were a lot harder than the first two."</p>
<p>"I know. I could hear it in your voice. You were really down for a few days, and... well, I was beginning to get worried about you."</p>
<p>He wondered whether she suspected the reason for his melancholy. Clearing his mind, he went on. "I was, but I'm over it now. I've already packed my bags."</p>
<p>"I hope you didn't take any unnecessary items."</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>"Like... I don't know... pajamas."</p>
<p>He laughed. "I don't own any pajamas."</p>
<p>"That's good. Because even if you did, you wouldn't need them."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Three days later, Garrett Blake arrived in Boston.</p>
<p>After picking him up from the airport, Theresa showed him around the city. They had lunch and took a quick tour of the Harvard campus. As usual, they held hands most of the day.</p>
<p>More than once, Garrett found himself wondering why the last three weeks had been so difficult for him. He knew that part of his anxiety stemmed from the dream, but spending time with Theresa made the troubling feelings seem distant and insubstantial.</p>
<p>When the day began to cool and the sun dipped below the trees, Theresa and Garrett stopped for some Mexican food to bring back to her apartment. Sitting on her living room floor in the glow of candlelight, Garrett looked around the room.</p>
<p>"You have a nice place," he said, eating. "It's bigger than my house."</p>
<p>"Only by a little, but thanks. It's real convenient to everything."</p>
<p>"Like restaurants?"</p>
<p>"Exactly. I wasn't kidding when I told you I didn't like to cook."</p>
<p>Outside her apartment, the sound of traffic was clearly audible.</p>
<p>"Is it always this quiet?" he asked.</p>
<p>She nodded toward the windows. "Friday and Saturday nights are the worst - usually it's not so bad. But you get used to it if you live here long enough."</p>
<p>"Would you like to put on some music?" Garrett asked.</p>
<p>"How about some jazz?"</p>
<p>"Sounds good."</p>
<p>Theresa got up and chose something she thought he might like and slipped it into the CD player. In a few moments the music started.</p>
<p>"So what do you think of Boston so far?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I like it. For a big city, it's not too bad. It doesn't seem as impersonal as I thought it would be, and it's cleaner, too. I guess I pictured it differently. You know - crowds, asphalt, tall buildings, not a tree in sight. But it's not like that at all."</p>
<p>She smiled. "It is nice, isn't it? I mean, it's not beachfront, but it has its own appeal. Especially if you consider what the city has to offer. You could go to the symphony, or to museums, or just stroll around in the parks. There's something for everyone here - they even have a sailing club."</p>
<p>"I can see why you like it here," he said, wondering why it sounded as if she were selling the place.</p>
<p>"I do. And Kevin likes it, too."</p>
<p>He changed the subject: "You said he's at soccer camp?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "Yeah. He's good at soccer."</p>
<p>She pushed their now empty plates to the side and moved closer. "But enough about Kevin," she said softly. "We don't always have to talk about him. We can talk about other things, you know."</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>She kissed his neck. "Like what I want to do with you now that I have you all to myself."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you just want to talk about it?"</p>
<p>"You're right," she whispered. "Who wants to talk at a time like this?"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day, Theresa again took Garrett on a tour of Boston, spending most of the morning in the Italian neighborhoods of the North End, wandering the narrow streets and stopping for the occasional cannoli and coffee. Though Garrett knew she wrote columns for the paper, he didn't know exactly what else her job involved. He asked her about it as they made their way through the city.</p>
<p>"Can't you write a column from your home?"</p>
<p>"In time, I suppose I can. But right now, it's not possible."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's not in my contract. Besides, I have to do a lot more than sit at my computer and write. Often, I have to interview people, so there's time involved in that - sometimes even a little travel. Plus, there's all the research I have to do, especially when I write about medical or psychological issues, and when I'm in the office, I have access to a lot more sources. And then there's the fact that I need a place where I can be reached. A lot of the stuff I do is human interest, and I get calls from people all day long. If I worked out of my home, I know a lot of people would call in the evenings when I'm spending time with Kevin, and I'm not willing to give up my time with him."</p>
<p>Garrett stopped at a sidewalk store selling fresh fruit. He picked out a couple of apples, then handed one to Theresa.</p>
<p>"What's the most popular thing you've ever written about in your column?" he asked.</p>
<p>Theresa felt her breath catch. The most popular? Easy - I found a message in a bottle once, and I got a couple of hundred letters.</p>
<p>She forced herself to think of something else. "Oh... I get a lot of letters when I write about teaching disabled children," she said finally.</p>
<p>"That must be rewarding," he said, paying the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>Before taking a bite of his apple, Garrett asked, "Could you still write your column even if you changed papers?"</p>
<p>She considered the question. "It would be hard to do, especially if I want to continue to syndicate. Since I'm still establishing my name, having the Boston Times behind me really helps. Why?"</p>
<p>"Just curious," he said quietly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next morning Theresa went into work for a few hours but was home a little after lunchtime. They spent the afternoon at the park, where they ate a picnic lunch. Their lunch was interrupted twice by people who recognized her from her picture in the paper, and Garrett realized that Theresa was actually more well-known than he had thought.</p>
<p>"I didn't know you were such a celebrity," he said after the second person walked away.</p>
<p>"I'm not really a celebrity. It's just that my picture appears above my column, so people know what I look like."</p>
<p>"Does this sort of thing happen a lot?"</p>
<p>"Not really. Maybe a few times a week."</p>
<p>"That's a lot," he said, surprised.</p>
<p>She was quiet for a moment.</p>
<p>"What someone like you could possibly see in me?" he asked.</p>
<p>She leaned over to kiss him. "I'll tell you what I see. I see the man that I love, the man who makes me happy... someone I want to continue to see for a long time."</p>
<p>"Why do you always know what to say?"</p>
<p>"Because," she said quietly, "I know more about you than you would ever suspect."</p>
<p>"Such as?"</p>
<p>A lazy smile played over her lips. "For instance, I know you want me to kiss you again."</p>
<p>"I do?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p>And she was right.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The rest of their vacation flew by. In the mornings, Theresa went into work for a few hours, then came home and spent the afternoons and evenings with Garrett. In the evenings, they either ordered something in or headed to one of the many small restaurants near her apartment. Sometimes they rented a movie to watch afterward, but usually they preferred to spend their time without other distractions.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning - the day he was leaving - they had brunch with Deanna and Brian. Garrett saw immediately what Theresa loved about Deanna. She was both charming and amusing, and Garrett found himself laughing throughout his meal. Deanna asked him about diving and sailing, while Brian speculated that if he owned his own business, he'd never get anything done because golf would simply take over his life.</p>
<p>Theresa was pleased that they got along so well. Excusing themselves after they'd eaten, Deanna and Theresa headed together into the bathroom to chat.</p>
<p>"So, what do you think?" Theresa asked expectantly.</p>
<p>"He's great," Deanna admitted. "He's even better looking than he was in the pictures you brought back."</p>
<p>"I know. My heart skips a beat whenever I look at him."</p>
<p>"Did your week turn out as well as you hoped?" Deanna asked.</p>
<p>"Even better."</p>
<p>Deanna beamed. "I could tell by the way he was looking at you that he really cares about you, too. The way you two act together reminds me of Brian and me. You seem like a good match."</p>
<p>"Do you really think so?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it."</p>
<p>Deanna took some lipstick out of her purse and began to apply it. "So, how did he like Boston?" she asked nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Theresa took out her own lipstick as well. "It's not what he's used to, but he enjoyed himself. We went to a lot of fun places."</p>
<p>"Did he say anything in particular?"</p>
<p>"No... why?" She looked at Deanna curiously.</p>
<p>"Because," Deanna answered, "I was just wondering if he'd said anything that might make you think he'd move here if you asked him to."</p>
<p>Her comment made Theresa think about something she'd been avoiding.</p>
<p>"We haven't talked about it yet," she said finally.</p>
<p>"Were you planning to?"</p>
<p>Not wanting to think about it, she shook her head. "I don't think it's the right time - at least not yet." She paused, gathering her thoughts. "I mean - I know we have to talk about it sometime, but I don't think we've known each other long enough to start making decisions about the future."</p>
<p>Deanna looked at her with motherly suspicion. "But you've known him long enough to fall in love with him, haven't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Theresa agreed.</p>
<p>"Then you know that this decision is coming, whether you want to face it or not."</p>
<p>It took a moment for her to answer. "I know."</p>
<p>Deanna put her hand on Theresa's shoulder. "What if it comes down to losing him or leaving Boston?"</p>
<p>Theresa considered. "I'm not sure," she said quietly, and looked at Deanna uncertainly.</p>
<p>"Can I give you some advice?" Deanna asked.</p>
<p>Theresa nodded.</p>
<p>"Whatever you decide to do, remember that you have to be able to go forward in life without looking back. If you're sure that Garrett can give you the kind of love that you need and you know you'll be happy, then you have to do whatever it takes to keep him. True love is rare, and it's the only thing that gives life real meaning."</p>
<p>"But doesn't the same thing apply to him? Shouldn't he be willing to sacrifice as well?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Then where does that leave me?"</p>
<p>"It leaves you with the same problem you had before, Theresa - one that you're definitely going to have to think about."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Over the next two months, they were able to get together three more times, each time for a weekend. Once, Theresa flew down to Wilmington so they could be alone, and they spent their time in Garrett's house, except for an evening they spent sailing. Garrett traveled to Boston twice, spending much of his time at Kevin's soccer tournaments. They were the first soccer games he'd ever attended, and he found himself caught up in the action more than he thought he would.</p>
<p>When they were together during those weekends, it was as if nothing else mattered in the world. Usually Kevin spent one of the nights at a friend's house so they could be alone, at least for a little while. They spent hours talking and laughing, holding each other close, and making love, trying to make up for weeks spent apart. Yet neither of them talked of what was going to happen to their relationship in the future. They lived moment to moment, neither of them exactly sure of what to expect from the other. Not that they weren't in love. Of that, at least, they were certain.</p>
<p>But because they didn't see each other very often, their relationship had more ups and downs than either of them had experienced before. Since everything felt right when they were together, everything felt wrong when they weren't. Garrett, especially, found himself struggling with the distance between them. Usually the good feelings he'd had when they saw each other lasted for a few days afterward, but then he'd find himself growing depressed as he anticipated the weeks before he saw her again.</p>
<p>He knew the distance between them was a problem. As he saw it, there were only two solutions - he could move, or she could move. One of them was going to have to change his or her life dramatically.</p>
<p>But which one?</p>
<p>He had his own business in Wilmington, the kind of life he wanted to live, the only life he knew how to live. Boston was nice to visit, but it wasn't home. He'd never even considered living somewhere else. And then there was his father - he was getting up in years, and Garrett was all he had.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Theresa had strong ties to Boston. Though her parents lived elsewhere, Kevin was in a school he liked, she had a blossoming career with a major newspaper, and she had a network of friends she'd have to leave. She'd worked hard to get where she was, and if she left Boston, she'd probably have to give it up. Would she be able to do that without resenting him for what he'd made her do?</p>
<p>Garrett didn't want to think about it. Instead, he focused on the fact that he loved Theresa, clinging to the belief that if they were meant to be together, they would find a way to do it.</p>
<p>Deep down, however, he knew it wasn't going to be that easy, and not just because of the distance between them. After he'd returned from his second trip to Boston, he had a picture of Theresa enlarged and framed. He set it on the bedstand opposite Catherine's picture, but despite his feelings for Theresa, it seemed out of place in his bedroom. A few days later, he moved the picture across the room, but it still didn't help. Wherever he put it, it seemed to him as if Catherine's eyes would follow it. Finally, he put Theresa's picture into the drawer. Sighing, he sat on the bed and held Catherine's picture in front of him.</p>
<p>"We didn't have these problems," he whispered as he ran his finger over her image. "With us, everything always seemed so easy, didn't it?"</p>
<p>When he realized the picture wouldn't answer, he cursed his foolishness and retrieved Theresa's picture.</p>
<p>Staring at them both, even he understood why he was having so much trouble with it all. He loved Theresa more than he ever thought he could... but he still loved Catherine...</p>
<p>Was it possible to love them both at once?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"I can't wait to see you again," Garrett said.</p>
<p>It was the middle of November, a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving Day. Theresa and Kevin were flying home to see her parents for the holidays, and Theresa had made arrangements to come down the weekend before to spend some time with Garrett. It had been a month since they'd seen each other.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to it, too," she said. "And you promised that I'd finally meet your father, right?"</p>
<p>"He's planning on cooking an early Thanksgiving dinner for us at his place. He keeps asking me what you like to eat. I think he wants to make a good impression."</p>
<p>"Tell him he doesn't have to worry. Anything he makes will be fine."</p>
<p>"That's what I keep telling him. But I can tell he's nervous about it."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because you'll be the first guest we've ever had over. For years, it's just been the two of us."</p>
<p>"Do you think he'll like me?"</p>
<p>"I know he will."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When he found out Theresa was coming, Jeb Blake did some things he hadn't ever done before. First, he hired someone to come in and clean the small house where he lived. He also bought a new shirt and tie. Emerging from his bedroom in his new clothes, he noticed the surprise in Garrett's eyes.</p>
<p>"How do I look?" he asked.</p>
<p>"You look fine, but why are you wearing a tie?"</p>
<p>"It's not for you - it's for dinner this weekend."</p>
<p>Garrett continued to stare at his father, smiling. "I don't think I've ever seen you in a tie before."</p>
<p>"I've worn them before. You just haven't noticed."</p>
<p>"You don't have to wear a tie just because Theresa is coming."</p>
<p>"I know that," he replied, "I just felt like wearing one to dinner this year."</p>
<p>"You're nervous about meeting her, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Dad - you don't have to be someone you're not. I'm sure Theresa would like you no matter how you were dressed."</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean I can't look nice for your lady friend, does it?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then I guess it's settled, isn't it? I didn't come out here to get your advice about it; I came out here to see if I looked okay."</p>
<p>"You look fine."</p>
<p>"Good. And... you're wearing a tie, too, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't planning on it."</p>
<p>"Well, change your plans. I don't want Theresa to find out that I raised someone who didn't know how to dress for company."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day before her arrival, Garrett helped his father finish his preparations. Garrett mowed the lawn while Jeb unpacked the wedding china and washed the dishes by hand. Then Jeb found a tablecloth in the closet. He put it into the washing machine just as Garrett came inside after finishing the yard.</p>
<p>"What time is she coming in tomorrow?" Jeb asked.</p>
<p>"Her plane gets in about ten o'clock. We should be here around eleven or so."</p>
<p>"What time do you think she'll want to eat?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"You didn't ask her?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then how will I know when to put the turkey in the oven?"</p>
<p>"Just plan on us eating sometime in the middle of the afternoon. Anytime is fine, I'm sure."</p>
<p>"Do you think you should call and ask her?"</p>
<p>"I really don't think it's necessary. It's not that important."</p>
<p>"Maybe not to you. But it's the first time I'll be meeting her, and if you two finally get married, I don't want to be the subject of any humorous stories later on."</p>
<p>Garrett raised his eyebrows. "Who said we're getting married?"</p>
<p>"No one."</p>
<p>"Then why did you say it?"</p>
<p>"Because," he said quickly, "I thought one of us had to, and I wasn't sure you were ever going to get to it."</p>
<p>Garrett stared at his father. "So, you think I should marry her?"</p>
<p>Jeb winked as he answered. "It doesn't matter what I think, it's what you think that's important, isn't it?"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Later that evening, Garrett opened his front door just as the phone began to ring. After rushing to the phone, he picked it up and heard the voice he expected.</p>
<p>"Garrett?" Theresa asked. "You sound out of breath."</p>
<p>He smiled. "Oh, hey, Theresa. I just walked in. My lather had me over at his house all day getting the place ready - he's really looking forward to meeting you."</p>
<p>There was an uncomfortable pause. "About tomorrow..." she said finally.</p>
<p>He felt his throat tighten. "What about tomorrow?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for her to answer. "I'm really sorry, Garrett... I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm not going to be able to go to Wilmington after all."</p>
<p>"Is something wrong?"</p>
<p>"No, everything's fine. It's just that something came up at the last minute - a big conference that I've got to go to."</p>
<p>"What kind of conference?"</p>
<p>"It's for my job." She paused again. "I know it sounds terrible, but I wouldn't go unless it was really important."</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. "What's it for?"</p>
<p>"It's for bigwig editors and media types - they're meeting in Dallas this weekend. Deanna thinks it would be a good idea if I met some of them."</p>
<p>"Did you just find out about it?"</p>
<p>"No... I mean, yes. Well - I knew there was going to be a meeting, but I wasn't supposed to go. Usually, columnists aren't invited, but Deanna pulled some strings and arranged for me to go with her." She hesitated. "I'm really sorry, Garrett, but it's an opportunity of a lifetime."</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment. Then he said simply, "I understand."</p>
<p>"You're angry with me, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure."</p>
<p>She knew by his tone that he wasn't telling the truth, but she didn't think there was anything she could say that would make him feel any better.</p>
<p>"Will you tell your father that I'm sorry?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'll tell him."</p>
<p>"Can I call you this weekend?"</p>
<p>"If you want to."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day he ate dinner with his father, who did his best to play down the whole affair.</p>
<p>"If it's like she said," his father explained, "she had a good reason. It's not like she can put her job on the back burner. She has a son to support, and she's got to do her best to provide for him. Besides, it's just one weekend - not much in the grand scheme of things."</p>
<p>Garrett nodded, listening to his father but still upset about the whole thing. Jeb went on.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you two will be able to work it out. In fact, she's probably going to do something real special the next time you two are together."</p>
<p>Garrett said nothing. Jeb took a couple of bites before speaking again.</p>
<p>"You've got to understand, Garrett - she's got responsibilities, just like you do, and sometimes those responsibilities take priority. I'm sure that if something happened in the shop that you had to take care of, you would have done the same thing."</p>
<p>Garrett leaned back, pushing his half-eaten plate to the side. "I understand all that, Dad. It's just that I haven't seen her for a month now, and I was really looking forward to her visit."</p>
<p>"Don't you think she wanted to see you, too?"</p>
<p>"She said she did."</p>
<p>Jeb leaned across the table and pushed Garrett's plate in front of him again. "Eat your dinner," he said. "I spent all day cooking, and you're not going to waste it."</p>
<p>Garrett looked at his plate. Though he wasn't hungry anymore, he picked up his fork and took a small bite.</p>
<p>"You know," his father said as he picked at his own food, "this isn't the last time this is going to happen, so you shouldn't get so down about it now."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that as long as you two continue to live a thousand miles apart, things like this are going to come up and you won't see each other as much as either one of you wants."</p>
<p>"Don't you think I know that?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure you do. But I don't know if either one of you has the guts to do something about it."</p>
<p>Garrett looked at his father.</p>
<p>"When I was young," Jeb continued, oblivious of his son's sour expression, "things were a lot simpler. If a man loved a woman, he asked her to marry him, and then they lived together. It was as simple as that. But you two - it's like you don't know what to do."</p>
<p>"I've told you before - it's not that easy..."</p>
<p>"Sure it is - if you love her, find a way to be with her. It's as simple as that. That way, if something comes up and you don't see each other one weekend, you don't end up acting like your life is over."</p>
<p>Jeb paused before continuing. "It just isn't natural what you two are trying to do, and in the long run, it isn't going to work. You know that, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I know," Garrett said simply, wishing his father would stop talking about it.</p>
<p>His father cocked his eyebrow, waiting. When Garrett didn't add anything else, Jeb spoke again.</p>
<p>"'I know'? That's all you have to say?"</p>
<p>He shrugged. "What else can I say?"</p>
<p>"You can say that the next time you see her, you two are going to figure this out. That's what you can say."</p>
<p>"Fine - we'll try to figure it out."</p>
<p>Jeb put his fork down and looked at his son. "I didn't say try, Garrett, I said that you two are going to figure this out."</p>
<p>"Why are you so adamant about it?"</p>
<p>"Because," he said, "if you two don't figure it out, you and me are going to keep eating alone for the next twenty years."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The following day, Garrett took Happenstance out first thing in the morning and stayed on the water until after the sun went down.</p>
<p>He called Theresa as soon as he got home that evening.</p>
<p>"Hello," she answered sleepily.</p>
<p>He spoke softly into the phone. "Hey, it's me."</p>
<p>"Garrett?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for waking you up, but you'd left a couple of messages on my answering machine."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you called. I wasn't sure you were going to."</p>
<p>"For a while, I didn't want to."</p>
<p>"Are you still mad at me?"</p>
<p>"No," he said quietly. "Sad, maybe, but not mad."</p>
<p>"Because I'm not there this weekend?"</p>
<p>"No. Because you're not here most weekends."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That night he dreamed again.</p>
<p>In his dream, Theresa and he were in Boston, walking along one of the busy city streets. The day was clear and bright, without a cloud in the sky, and Garrett was enjoying spending the day with her.</p>
<p>Theresa stopped at the window of a small craft store and asked if Garrett wanted to go inside. Shaking his head, he said, "You go ahead. I'll wait for you here." Theresa stepped inside. Garrett stood outside the door, relaxing in the shade of the tall buildings, when he saw something familiar out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>It was a woman, walking along the sidewalk. Something in the way she moved struck him, and he watched her as she slowly moved away. Finally, the woman stopped and turned her head, as if remembering something. Garrett felt his breath catch.</p>
<p>Catherine.</p>
<p>It couldn't be.</p>
<p>He shook his head. At this distance, he couldn't tell if he was mistaken or not.</p>
<p>She started to walk away again just as Garrett called to her.</p>
<p>"Catherine - is it you?"</p>
<p>She didn't hear him above the noise of the street. Garrett glanced over his shoulder and spotted Theresa in the shop, browsing. When he looked back up the street, Catherine - or whoever she was - was turning the corner.</p>
<p>He started toward her, walking quickly, then he began to run. Once around the corner, the street grew darker. He stopped for a moment to catch his breath; his heart was pounding in his chest. As he did so, fog began to roll in, almost like a wave, and soon he couldn't see anything more than a few feet away.</p>
<p>"Catherine - are you here?" he shouted. "Where are you?"</p>
<p>He heard laughter in the distance, though he couldn't make out exactly where it was coming from.</p>
<p>He started walking again, slowly. Again, he heard the laughter - childlike, happy. He stopped.</p>
<p>"Where are you?"</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>He looked from side to side.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>The fog grew steadily thicker as a light rain began to fall. He started moving again, unsure where he was going.</p>
<p>Something darted into the fog, and he moved quickly toward it.</p>
<p>She was walking away, only a few feet in front of him.</p>
<p>The rain began to fall harder now. He began to jog... slowly... slowly... He could see her just ahead...</p>
<p>And then she was gone. He stopped again. The rain and fog made it impossible to see anymore.</p>
<p>"Where are you?" he shouted again.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>"Where are you?" he shouted, even louder this time.</p>
<p>"I'm here," a voice said from the rain and mist.</p>
<p>He wiped the rain from his face. "Catherine?.. Is it really you?"</p>
<p>"It's me, Garrett."</p>
<p>But it wasn't her voice.</p>
<p>Theresa stepped out of the fog. "I'm here."</p>
<p>Garrett woke and sat up in bed, sweating. Wiping his face with the sheet, he sat up for a long time afterward.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Later that day, Garrett met with his father.</p>
<p>"I think I want to marry her, Dad."</p>
<p>They were fishing together at the end of the pier with a dozen other people, most of whom were lost in thought. Jeb looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>"Two days ago, it didn't seem like you wanted to see her again."</p>
<p>"I've done a lot of thinking since then."</p>
<p>"Do you love her?" Jeb asked.</p>
<p>Garrett looked at him, surprised. "Of course I do. I've told you that a few times."</p>
<p>Jeb Blake shook his head. "No... you haven't," he said sincerely. "We've talked about her a lot - you've told me that she makes you happy, that you feel like you know her, and that you don't want to lose her - but you've never told me that you love her."</p>
<p>"It's the same thing."</p>
<p>"Is it?"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After he'd gone home, the conversation he'd had with his father kept repeating itself in his mind.</p>
<p>"Is it?"</p>
<p>"Of course it is," he'd said right away. "And even if it isn't, I really love her."</p>
<p>Jeb stared at his son for a moment before finally turning away. "You want to marry her?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I love her, that's why. Isn't that enough?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>Garrett reeled in his line, frustrated. "Weren't you the one who thought we should get married in the first place?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"So why are you questioning it now?"</p>
<p>"Because I want to make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Two days ago, you weren't even sure if you wanted to see her again. Now, you're ready for marriage. It just seems like a mighty big turnaround to me, and I want to make sure it's because of the way you feel about Theresa - and that it doesn't have anything to do with Catherine."</p>
<p>"Catherine doesn't have anything to do with this," Garrett said quickly. He shook his head and sighed deeply. "You know, Dad, I don't understand you sometimes. You've been pushing me into this the whole time. You kept telling me I had to put the past behind me, that I had to find someone new. And now that I have, it seems like you're trying to talk me out of it."</p>
<p>Jeb put his free hand on Garrett's shoulder. "I'm not talking you out of anything, Garrett. I'm glad you found Theresa; I'm glad that you love her, and yes, I do hope that you end up marrying her. I just said that if you're going to get married, then you should do it for the right reasons. Marriage is between two people, not three. And it's not fair to her if you go into it otherwise."</p>
<p>It took a moment for him to respond.</p>
<p>"Dad, I want to get married because I love her. I want to spend my life with her."</p>
<p>His father stood silently for a long time, watching. Then he said something that made Garrett look away.</p>
<p>"So, in other words, you're telling me that you're completely over Catherine?"</p>
<p>Though he felt the weight of his father's gaze, Garrett didn't know the answer.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Are you tired?" Garrett asked.</p>
<p>He was lying on his bed as he spoke with Theresa on the phone.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got in just a little while ago. It was a long weekend."</p>
<p>"Did it turn out as well as you hoped it would?"</p>
<p>"I hope so. There's no way to tell just yet, but I met a lot of people who could eventually help me out with my column."</p>
<p>"It's a good thing you went, then."</p>
<p>"Good and bad. Most of the time, I wanted to visit you instead."</p>
<p>He smiled. "When do you leave for your parents'?"</p>
<p>"Wednesday morning. I'll be gone until Sunday."</p>
<p>"Are they looking forward to seeing you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, they are. They haven't seen Kevin for almost a year."</p>
<p>There was a short pause.</p>
<p>"Garrett?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>She spoke softly. "I just want you to know that I'm still really sorry about this weekend."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"Can I make it up to you?"</p>
<p>"What did you have in mind?"</p>
<p>"Well... can you come up here to visit the weekend after Thanksgiving?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so."</p>
<p>"Good, because I'm going to plan a special weekend just for the two of us."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Garrett arrived in Boston two weeks later, Theresa met him at the airport. She had told him to wear something dressy, and he walked off the plane wearing a blazer, something she'd never seen him in before.</p>
<p>"Wow," she'd said simply.</p>
<p>He adjusted the blazer self-consciously. "Do I look okay?"</p>
<p>"You look great."</p>
<p>They went straight from the airport to dinner. She'd made reservations at the most elegant restaurant in town. They had a wonderful meal, and afterward Theresa took Garrett to the theatre.</p>
<p>It was late by the time they got back, and to Garrett, the following day seemed rushed, too. Theresa took him to her office and showed him around - introducing him to a couple of people - and afterward they visited the Museum of Fine Arts for the rest of the afternoon. That evening they met Deanna and Brian for dinner at a restaurant on the top floor that offered wonderful views of the entire city.</p>
<p>Garrett had never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>Their table was near the window. Deanna and Brian both rose from their seats to greet them. "You remember Garrett from brunch, don't you?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>"Of course I do. It's good to see you again, Garrett," Deanna said. "I'm sorry I forced Theresa to come with me a couple of weeks ago. I hope you haven't been too hard on her."</p>
<p>"It's okay," he said, nodding stiffly.</p>
<p>"I'm glad. Because looking back, I think it was worth it."</p>
<p>Garrett looked at her curiously. Theresa asked, "What do you mean, Deanna?"</p>
<p>Deanna's eyes sparkled. "I got some good news yesterday, after you left."</p>
<p>"What is it?" Theresa asked.</p>
<p>"Well," she said nonchalantly, "I talked to Dan Mandel, the head of Media Information Inc., for about twenty minutes or so, and it turns out he was very impressed with you. He liked the way you handled yourself and thought you were quite a pro. And best of all..."</p>
<p>Deanna paused dramatically.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"He's going to pick up your column in all his papers, starting in January."</p>
<p>"You're kidding," Theresa cried, disbelieving.</p>
<p>Deanna shook her head, smiling broadly. "No. I'm telling you what he told me. He wants to talk to you again on Tuesday."</p>
<p>"You're sure about this? He wants my column?"</p>
<p>"Positive. It's something he's already decided."</p>
<p>"I can't believe it."</p>
<p>"Believe it. And I heard through the grapevine that a couple of others are interested as well."</p>
<p>"Oh... Deanna..."</p>
<p>Theresa leaned in and impulsively hugged Deanna. Brian nudged Garrett with his elbow.</p>
<p>"Great news, huh?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for Garrett to answer.</p>
<p>"Yeah... great."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Deanna ordered a bottle of champagne and made a toast, congratulating Theresa on her bright future. The two of them chatted nonstop throughout the rest of the evening. Garrett was quiet, not knowing quite what to add. As if sensing his discomfort, Brian leaned over to Garrett.</p>
<p>"They're like schoolgirls, aren't they?"</p>
<p>"I just wish I understood it all a little better. I don't really know what to say."</p>
<p>Brian took a drink and said, "you'll understand it better when you live with it full-time. After a while, you'll understand it almost as well as they do. I know I do."</p>
<p>The comment was noticed. When you live with it full-time?</p>
<p>When Garrett didn't respond, Brian changed the subject. "So how long are you staying?"</p>
<p>"Until tomorrow night."</p>
<p>Brian nodded. "It's hard not seeing each other much, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes."</p>
<p>"I can imagine. I know Theresa gets upset about it."</p>
<p>Across the table, Theresa smiled at Garrett. "What are you two talking about over there?" she asked cheerfully.</p>
<p>"This and that," Brian said, "your good fortune, mainly."</p>
<p>Garrett nodded briefly without answering, and Theresa watched as he adjusted himself in his seat. It was obvious he felt uncomfortable - though she wasn't sure why.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"You were quiet tonight," Theresa said.</p>
<p>They were back in her apartment, sitting on the couch with the radio playing softly in the background.</p>
<p>"I guess I didn't have much to say."</p>
<p>She took his hand and spoke quietly. "I'm glad you were with me when Deanna told me the news."</p>
<p>"I'm happy for you, Theresa. I know it means a lot to you."</p>
<p>She smiled uncertainly. Changing the subject, she asked, "Did you have a good time talking to Brian?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... he's easy to get along with." He paused. "But I'm not very good in groups. I just..." He stopped, considering whether he should say anything else, and decided not to.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "Nothing."</p>
<p>"No - what were you going to say?"</p>
<p>After a moment, he answered, choosing his words carefully. "I was just going to say that this whole weekend has been strange for me. The show, expensive dinners, going out with your friends..." He shrugged. "It isn't what I expected."</p>
<p>"Aren't you having a good time?"</p>
<p>He ran his hands through his hair, looking uncomfortable again. "It's not that I haven't had fun. It's just..." He shrugged. "It's not me. None of this is anything I'd normally do."</p>
<p>"That's why I planned the weekend like I did. I wanted to introduce you to new things."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"For the same reason you wanted me to learn how to dive - because it's something exciting, something different."</p>
<p>"I didn't come up here to do something different. I came up here to spend some quiet time with you. I haven't seen you for a long time, and ever since we've been up here, it seems like we've been rushing from place to place. We haven't even had a chance to talk yet and I'm leaving tomorrow."</p>
<p>"That's not true. We were alone at dinner last night, and again at the museum today. We've had plenty of time to talk."</p>
<p>"You know what I mean."</p>
<p>"No, I don't. What did you want to do - sit around in the apartment?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer. Instead, he sat quietly for a moment. Then he rose from the couch, walked across the room, and turned off the radio.</p>
<p>"There's something important I've wanted to say since I came up here," he said without turning around.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>He lowered his head. It's now or never, he whispered to himself.</p>
<p>"I guess it's just been really hard this past month not seeing you, and right now, I'm not sure if I want to keep going on like this," he said.</p>
<p>Her breath caught for a second.</p>
<p>Seeing her expression, he moved toward her. "It's not what you're thinking," he said quickly. "You've got it completely wrong. It's not that I don't want to see you anymore, I want to see you all the time." When he reached the couch, he kneeled in front of her. Theresa looked at him, surprised. He took her hand in his.</p>
<p>"I want you to move to Wilmington."</p>
<p>Though she'd known this was coming sometime, she hadn't expected it to come up now, and certainly not like this. Garrett went on.</p>
<p>"I know it's a big step, but if you move down, we won't have these long periods apart anymore. We could see each other every day." He reached up, caressing her cheek. "I want to walk the beach with you, and I want to go sailing with you. I want you to be there when I get home from the shop..."</p>
<p>The words were coming quickly, and Theresa tried to make sense of them. Garrett kept talking.</p>
<p>"I just miss you so much when we're not together. I realize your job is here, but I'm sure the local paper would take you on..."</p>
<p>The more he talked, the more her head began to spin. To her, it almost sounded as if he were trying to re-create his relationship with Catherine. "Wait a minute," she finally said, cutting him off. "I can't just pick up and leave. I mean. Kevin's in school..."</p>
<p>"You don't have to come right away," he said. "You can wait until school is out if that would be better. We've made it this long - another few months won't make much difference."</p>
<p>"But he's happy here - this is his home. He's got his friends, his soccer..."</p>
<p>"He can have all that in Wilmington."</p>
<p>"You don't know that. It's easy for you to say that he will, but you don't know that for sure."</p>
<p>"Didn't you see how well we got along?"</p>
<p>She let go of his hand, growing frustrated. "That has nothing to do with it, don't you see? I know you two got along, but you weren't asking him to change his life. I wasn't asking him change his life." She paused. "And besides, this isn't all about him. What about me, Garrett? You were there tonight - you know what happened. I just got some wonderful news about my column and now you want me to give that up, too?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to give us up. There's a big difference."</p>
<p>"Then why can't you move to Boston?"</p>
<p>"And do what?"</p>
<p>"The same thing you do in Wilmington. Teach diving, go sailing, whatever. It's a lot easier for you to leave than it would be for me."</p>
<p>"I can't do that. Like I said, this" - he motioned around the room and toward the windows - "isn't me. I'd be lost up here."</p>
<p>Theresa stood up and walked across the room, agitated. "That isn't fair."</p>
<p>"What isn't fair?"</p>
<p>She faced him. "This whole thing. Asking me to move, asking me to change my whole life. It's like you've put a condition on it - 'We can be together, but it's got to be my way.' Well, what about my feelings? Aren't they important, too?"</p>
<p>"Of course they're important. You're important - we're important."</p>
<p>"Well - you don't make it sound that way. It's like you're only thinking about yourself. You want me to give up everything I've worked for, but you're not willing to give up anything."</p>
<p>Garrett rose from the couch and moved toward her. When he got close, she pulled back, raising her arms like a barrier.</p>
<p>"Look, Garrett - I don't want you to touch me right now, okay?"</p>
<p>He dropped his hands to his sides. For a long moment, neither of them said anything. Theresa crossed her arms and glanced away.</p>
<p>"Then I guess your answer is that you're not coming," he finally said, sounding angry.</p>
<p>She spoke carefully. "No. My answer is that we're going to have to discuss it."</p>
<p>"So you can try to convince me that I'm wrong?"</p>
<p>His comment didn't deserve a response. Shaking her head, she walked to the dining room table, picked up her purse, and started toward the front door.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to get some wine. I need a drink."</p>
<p>"But it's late."</p>
<p>"There's a store at the end of the block. I'll be back in a couple of minutes."</p>
<p>"Why can't we talk about it now?"</p>
<p>"Because," she said quickly, "I need a few minutes alone so I can think."</p>
<p>"You're running out?" It sounded like an accusation.</p>
<p>She opened the door, holding it as she spoke. "No, Garrett, I'm not running out. I'll be back in a few minutes. And I don't appreciate you talking to me like that. It's not fair of you to make me feel guilty about this. You've just asked me to change my entire life, and I'm taking a few minutes to think about it."</p>
<p>She left the apartment. Garrett stared at the door for a couple of seconds, waiting to see if she would come back. When she didn't, he cursed himself silently. Nothing had turned out as he thought it would.</p>
<p>Not knowing what else to do, he paced around the apartment. He glanced in the kitchen, then Kevin's room, and kept moving. When he reached her bedroom, he paused for a moment before entering. After walking over to her bed, he sat down, putting his head into his hands.</p>
<p>Was it fair of him to ask her to leave? She had a life here - a good life - but he felt sure that she could have that in Wilmington. No matter how he looked at it, it would probably be much better than their life together up here. Looking around, he knew there was no way he could live in an apartment. But even if they moved to a house - would it have a view? Or would they live in a suburb, surrounded by a dozen houses that looked exactly the same?</p>
<p>It was complicated. And somehow, everything he'd said had come out wrong. He hadn't wanted her to feel as if he were giving her an ultimatum, but thinking back, he realized that was exactly what he had done.</p>
<p>Sighing, he wondered what to do next. He didn't think there was anything he could say when she got back that wouldn't lead to another argument. Above all, he didn't want that. Arguments rarely led to solutions, and that's what they needed now.</p>
<p>But if he couldn't say anything, what else was there? He thought for a moment before finally deciding to write her a letter, outlining his thoughts. Writing always made him think more clearly - especially over the last few years.</p>
<p>He glanced toward her bedside table. Her phone was there - she probably took messages now and then - but he didn't see either a pen or pad. He opened the drawer, searched through it, and found a pen near the front.</p>
<p>Looking for some paper, he continued shuffling - through magazines, a couple of paperback books, some empty jewelry boxes - when something familiar caught his eye.</p>
<p>A sailing ship.</p>
<p>It was on a piece of paper, between a slim Day-Timer and an old copy of Ladies' Home Journal. He reached for it, assuming it was one of the letters he'd written to her over the last couple of months, and then suddenly froze.</p>
<p>How could that be?</p>
<p>The stationery had been a gift from Catherine, and he used it only when he wrote to her. His letters to Theresa had been written on different paper, something he'd picked up at the store.</p>
<p>He found himself holding his breath. He quickly made room in the drawer, removing the magazine and gently lifted out, not one, but five - five! - pieces of the stationery. Still confused, he blinked hard before glancing at the first page, and there were the words:</p>
<p>My Dearest Catherine...</p>
<p>He turned to the second page, a photocopy.</p>
<p>My Darling Catherine...</p>
<p>The next letter.</p>
<p>Dear Catherine...</p>
<p>"What is this," he muttered, unable to believe what he was seeing. "It can't be -" He looked over the pages again just to make sure.</p>
<p>But it was true. One was real, two were copies, but they were his letters, the letters he had written to Catherine. The letters he had written after his dreams, the letters he dropped from Happenstance and never expected to see again.</p>
<p>On impulse he began to read them, and with each word, each phrase, he felt his emotions rushing to the surface. The dreams, his memories, his loss, the anguish. He stopped</p>
<p>His mouth went dry as he pressed his lips together. Instead of reading any more, he simply stared at them in shock. He barely heard the front door open and then close. Theresa called out, "Garrett, I'm back." She paused, and he could hear her walking through the apartment. Then, "Where are you?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer. He couldn't do anything but try to grasp how this had happened. How could she have them? They were his letters... his personal letters.</p>
<p>The letters to his wife.</p>
<p>Letters that were no one else's business.</p>
<p>Theresa stepped into the room and looked at him. Though he didn't know it, his face was pale.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" she asked, not realizing what was in his hands.</p>
<p>For a moment, it was as if he hadn't heard her. Then, looking up slowly, he glared at her.</p>
<p>Startled, she almost spoke again. But she didn't. Like a wave, everything hit her at the same time - the open drawer, the papers in his hand, the expression on his face - and she knew immediately what had happened.</p>
<p>"Garrett... I can explain," she said quickly, quietly. It seemed he didn't hear her.</p>
<p>"My letters..." he whispered. He looked at her, with a mixture of confusion and rage.</p>
<p>"I..."</p>
<p>"How did you get my letters?" he demanded. The sound of his voice made her flinch.</p>
<p>"I found one washed up at the beach and -"</p>
<p>He cut her off. "You found it?"</p>
<p>She nodded, trying to explain. "When I was at the Cape. I was jogging and I came across the bottle..."</p>
<p>He glanced at the first page, the only original letter. He had written the one earlier that year. But the others...</p>
<p>"What about these?" he asked, holding up the copies. "Where did they come from?"</p>
<p>Theresa answered softly. "They were sent to me."</p>
<p>"By whom?" Confused, he rose from the bed.</p>
<p>She took a step toward him, holding out her hand. "By other people who'd found them. One of the people read my column..."</p>
<p>"You published my letter?" He sounded as if he'd just been hit in the stomach.</p>
<p>She didn't answer for a moment. "I didn't know..." she began.</p>
<p>"You didn't know what?" he said loudly. The hurt was evident in his tone. "That it was wrong to do that? That this wasn't something that I wanted the world to see?"</p>
<p>"It was washed up on the beach - you had to know someone would find it," she said quickly. "I didn't use your names."</p>
<p>"But you put it in the paper..." He trailed off in disbelief.</p>
<p>"Garrett... I -"</p>
<p>"Don't," he said angrily. He glanced at the letters, and then looked back at her, as if he were seeing her for the first time. "You lied to me," he said, almost as if it were a revelation.</p>
<p>"I didn't lie..."</p>
<p>He wasn't listening. "You lied to me," he repeated, as if to himself. "And you came to find me. Why? So that you could write another column. Is that what this is about?"</p>
<p>"No... it isn't like that at all..."</p>
<p>"Then what was it?"</p>
<p>"After reading your letters, I... I wanted to meet you."</p>
<p>He didn't understand what she was saying. He kept looking from the letters to her and back again.</p>
<p>"You lied to me," he said for the third time. "You used me."</p>
<p>"I didn't..."</p>
<p>"Yes, you did!" he shouted; his voice was echoing in the room. Remembering Catherine, he held the letters out in front of him, as if Theresa had never seen them before. "These were mine - my feelings, my thoughts, my way of dealing with the loss of my wife. Mine - not yours."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to hurt you."</p>
<p>He stared hard at her without saying anything. His jaw muscles tensed.</p>
<p>"This whole thing is a sham, isn't it?" he said finally, not waiting for her to answer. "You took my feelings for Catherine and tried to manipulate them into something you wanted. You thought that because I loved Catherine, I would love you, too, didn't you?"</p>
<p>Despite herself, she paled. She felt suddenly incapable of speech.</p>
<p>"You planned all this from the beginning, didn't you?" He paused again. When he spoke, his voice began to crack. "The whole thing was set up -"</p>
<p>He seemed dazed for a moment, and she reached out to him.</p>
<p>"Garrett - yes, I admit I wanted to meet you. The letters were so beautiful - I wanted to see what kind of person writes like that. But I didn't know where it would lead; I didn't plan on anything after that." She took his hand. "I love you, Garrett. You've got to believe me."</p>
<p>When she finished speaking, he pulled his hand free and moved away.</p>
<p>"What kind of person are you?"</p>
<p>The comment stung, and she responded defensively, "It's not what you think..."</p>
<p>Garrett pressed on, oblivious of her response. "You got caught up in some weird fantasy..."</p>
<p>That was too much. "Stop it, Garrett!" she cried angrily, hurt by his words. "You didn't listen to anything I said!" As she shouted, she felt tears welling up in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Why should I listen? You've been lying to me ever since I've known you."</p>
<p>"I didn't lie! I just never told you about the letters!"</p>
<p>"Because you knew it was wrong!"</p>
<p>"No - because I knew you wouldn't understand," she said, trying to regain her composure.</p>
<p>"I understand all right. I understand what kind of person you are!"</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed. "Don't be like this".</p>
<p>"Be like what? Mad? Hurt? I just found out this whole thing was a charade, and now you want me to stop?"</p>
<p>"Shut up!" she shouted back; her anger suddenly rose to the surface.</p>
<p>He seemed stunned by her words, and he stared at her without speaking. Finally, with breaking voice, he held out the letters again.</p>
<p>"You think you understand what Catherine and I had together, but you don't. No matter how many letters you read - no matter how well you know me - you'll never understand. What she and I had was real. It was real, and she was real..."</p>
<p>He paused, collecting his thoughts, regarding her as if she were a stranger. Then, stiffening, he said something that hurt her worse than anything he'd said so far.</p>
<p>"We've never even come close to what Catherine and I had."</p>
<p>He didn't wait for a response. Instead, he walked past her, toward his suitcase. After throwing everything inside, he zipped it quickly. He stood, lifting his bag. "These," he said, holding the letters, "are mine, and I'm taking them with me."</p>
<p>Suddenly realizing what he intended to do, she asked, "Why are you leaving?"</p>
<p>He stared at her. "I don't even know who you are."</p>
<p>Without another word, he turned around and strode through the living room and out the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p>
<p>Not knowing where else to go, Garrett caught a cab to the airport after leaving Theresa's apartment. Unfortunately, no flights were available, and he stayed in the terminal the rest of the night, still angry and unable to sleep.</p>
<p>The following morning he caught the first flight he could. He got home a little after eleven and then went straight to his room. As he lay in bed, however, the events of the evening before kept running through his head, keeping him awake. Trying and failing to fall asleep, he eventually gave up. He showered and dressed, then sat on his bed again. Staring at the photograph of Catherine, he eventually picked it up and carried it with him into the living room. On the coffee table, he found the letters where he'd left them. Now, with her picture in front of him, he read the letters slowly, sensing Catherine's presence filling the room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Hey, I thought you'd forgotten about our date," he said as he watched Catherine walking down the dock with a grocery bag.</p>
<p>Smiling, Catherine took his hand as she stepped on board. "I didn't forget, I just had a little detour on the way."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Actually, I went to see the doctor."</p>
<p>He took the bag from her. "Are you okay? I know you haven't been feeling well - "</p>
<p>"I'm okay," she said, cutting him off gently. "But I don't think I'm up for a sail tonight."</p>
<p>"Something is wrong, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Catherine smiled again as she leaned over and pulled a small package out of one of the bags. Garrett watched as she began to open it.</p>
<p>"Close your eyes," she said, "and I'll tell you all about it."</p>
<p>Still a little unsure, Garrett nonetheless did as she asked and heard as paper was unwrapped. "Okay, you can open them now."</p>
<p>Catherine was holding up baby clothes in front of her.</p>
<p>"What's this?" he asked, not understanding.</p>
<p>She was smiling happily. "I'm pregnant," she said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Pregnant?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh. I'm officially eight weeks along."</p>
<p>"Eight weeks?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>Hesitating from the shock, Garrett took the baby clothes and held them delicately in his hand, then finally leaned forward and gave Catherine a hug. "I can't believe it..."</p>
<p>"It's true."</p>
<p>A broad smile crossed his lips as the realization finally began to sink in. "You're pregnant."</p>
<p>Catherine closed her eyes and whispered in his ear, "And you're going to be a father."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Garrett's thoughts were interrupted by the squeaking of the door. His father peeked his head into the room.</p>
<p>"I saw your truck out front. I wanted to make sure everything was okay," he said in explanation. "I didn't expect you back here until this evening." When Garrett didn't respond, his father walked in and immediately spotted Catherine's picture on the table. "You're okay, son?" he asked cautiously.</p>
<p>They sat in the living room while Garrett explained the situation from the beginning - the dreams he'd been having over the years, the messages he'd been sending by bottle, finally moving on to the argument they'd had the night before. He left nothing out. When he finished, his father took the letters from Garrett's hand.</p>
<p>"I guess it was quite a shock," he said, glancing at the pages, surprised that Garrett had never mentioned the letters to him. He paused. "But don't you think you were a little rough on her?"</p>
<p>Garrett shook his head tiredly. "She knew everything about me. Dad, and she never told me. She set the whole thing up."</p>
<p>"No, she didn't," he said gently. "She came down to meet you, but she didn't make you fall in love with her. You did that on your own."</p>
<p>Garrett looked away before finally returning his gaze to the picture on the table. "But don't you think it was wrong of her to hide it from me?"</p>
<p>Jeb sighed. "A couple of weeks ago, when we were talking on the pier, you told me you wanted to marry Theresa because you loved her. Do you remember that?"</p>
<p>Garrett nodded absently.</p>
<p>"Why has that changed?"</p>
<p>Garrett looked at his father, confused. "I've already told you that -"</p>
<p>Jeb gently cut him off before he could finish.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you've explained your reasons, but you haven't been honest about it. Not with me, not with Theresa, not even with yourself. She didn't tell you about the letters, and maybe it was wrong. But that's not why you're still angry now. You're angry because she made you realize something that you didn't want to admit."</p>
<p>Garrett looked at his father without responding. Then, rising from the couch, he went to the kitchen, suddenly feeling the desire to escape the conversation. In the refrigerator, he found a pitcher of sweet tea and poured himself a glass.</p>
<p>As Garrett was in the kitchen, Jeb stared at the picture of Catherine, remembering his own wife from long ago. He put the letters beside it and walked to the sliding glass door. Opening it, he watched as cold December winds from the Atlantic made the waves crash violently. Suddenly he heard a knock at the door.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, Garrett apparently hadn't heard the knock. Jeb went to answer it.</p>
<p>When the front door swung open, wind gusted through the living room, scattering the letters to the floor. Jeb, however, didn't notice. All his attention was focused on the visitor on the porch.</p>
<p>Standing before him was a dark-haired young woman he'd never seen before. He paused in the doorway, knowing exactly who she was but finding himself at a loss for words'. He moved aside to make room for her.</p>
<p>"Come on in," he said quietly.</p>
<p>As she entered, closing the door behind her, the wind abruptly died. She glanced at Jeb, uncomfortable. For a moment, neither spoke.</p>
<p>"You must be Theresa," Jeb finally said. "I've heard a lot about you."</p>
<p>She crossed her arms, hesitating. "I know I'm not expected..."</p>
<p>"It's okay," Jeb encouraged.</p>
<p>"Is he here?"</p>
<p>Jeb nodded his head in the direction of the kitchen. "Yeah, he's here. He's getting something to drink."</p>
<p>"How is he?"</p>
<p>Jeb shrugged and gave her a slow smile. "You'll have to talk to him..."</p>
<p>Theresa nodded, suddenly wondering whether coming down was a good idea. She glanced around the room and immediately saw the letters spread around the floor. She also noticed Garrett's bag sitting by his bedroom door, still packed from his visit. Other than that, the house looked exactly the same as it always did.</p>
<p>Except, of course, for the photograph.</p>
<p>She spotted it over Jeb's shoulder. Normally it was in his room, and for some reason, now that it was in plain view, she couldn't take her eyes off it. She was still staring at the picture when Garrett reentered the living room.</p>
<p>"Dad, what happened in here -"</p>
<p>He froze. Theresa faced him uncertainly. For a long moment, neither of them said anything. Then Theresa took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Hello, Garrett," she said.</p>
<p>Garrett said nothing. Jeb picked up his keys from the table, knowing it was time to leave.</p>
<p>"You two have a lot to talk about, so I'll get out of here."</p>
<p>He went to the front door, glancing at Theresa. "It was nice meeting you," he murmured. But as he spoke, he raised his eyebrows and shrugged slightly, as if to wish her luck. In a moment, he was outside, making his way down the walk.</p>
<p>"Why are you here?" Garrett asked evenly once they were alone.</p>
<p>"I wanted to come," she said quietly. "I wanted to see you again."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>She didn't answer. Instead, after a moment's hesitation, she walked toward him, her eyes never leaving his. Once she was close, she put her finger to his lips and shook her head to stop him from speaking "Shh," she whispered, "no questions... just for now. Please..." She tried to smile, but now that he could see her better, he knew she'd been crying.</p>
<p>There was nothing she could say. There were no words to describe what she'd been going through.</p>
<p>Instead, she wrapped her arms around him. Reluctantly he drew his arms around her as she rested her head against him. She kissed his neck and pulled him closer.</p>
<p>In the living room, with the roar of the ocean echoing through the house, they held each other tightly, giving in to their growing desires. Finally, Theresa pulled back, reaching for his hand as she did so. Taking it in hers, she led him to the bedroom.</p>
<p>They made love fiercely, clinging desperately to each other.</p>
<p>Afterward she sat up in the bed, stroking Garrett's head. She ran her hands through his hair, rhythmically, steadily, listening as the sound of his breathing gradually deepened.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, Garrett woke up alone. Noticing that Theresa's clothes were gone as well, he grabbed his jeans and shirt. Still buttoning his shirt as he left his bedroom, he quickly searched the house for her.</p>
<p>The house was cold.</p>
<p>He found her in the kitchen. She was seated at the table, wearing her jacket. On the table in front of her, he saw a cup of coffee, nearly empty. Checking the clock, he realized he'd been asleep for almost two hours.</p>
<p>"Hey there," he said uncertainly.</p>
<p>Theresa glanced over her shoulder at him. Her voice was subdued.</p>
<p>"Oh, hey... I didn't hear you get up."</p>
<p>"You okay?"</p>
<p>She didn't answer directly. "Come sit with me," she said instead. "There's a lot I've got to tell you."</p>
<p>Garrett sat down at the table. Theresa fidgeted with the coffee cup for a moment; her eyes were downcast. Finally, without looking at him, she reached into her lap and removed the letters, laying them on the table. Apparently, she'd gathered them up while he slept.</p>
<p>"I found the bottle when I was jogging last summer," she began, her voice steady but distant, as if recalling something painful. "I didn't have any idea what the letter inside would say, but after reading it, I started to cry. It was just so beautiful - I knew it had come straight from your heart, and the way it was written... I guess I understood the things you wrote because I felt so alone, too."</p>
<p>She looked at him. "That morning, I showed it to Deanna. Publishing it was her idea. I didn't want to at first... I thought it was too personal, but she didn't see the harm in it. She thought it would be a nice thing for people to read. So I agreed, and assumed that would be the end of it. But it wasn't."</p>
<p>She sighed. "After I got back to Boston, I got a call from someone who'd read the column. She sent me the second letter, one that she'd found a few years ago. After I read it, I was intrigued, but again, I didn't think it would go any further."</p>
<p>She paused. "Have you ever heard of Yankee magazine?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"It's a regional magazine. It's not well-known outside of New England, but it publishes some good stories. That's where I found the third letter."</p>
<p>Garrett looked at her in surprise. "It was published there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was. I tracked down the author of the article and he sent me the third letter, and... well, curiosity got the best of me. I had three letters, Garrett - not just one but three - and every one of them touched me the same way the first one had. So, with Deanna's help, I found out who you were and I came down to meet you."</p>
<p>She smiled sadly. "I know it sounds like you said - that it was some sort of fantasy - but it wasn't. I didn't come down here to fall in love with you. I didn't come down here to write a column. I came down to see who you were, that was all. I wanted to meet the person who wrote those beautiful letters. So I went to the docks and there you were. We talked, and then, if you remember, you asked me to go sailing. If you hadn't, I probably would have gone home that day."</p>
<p>He didn't know what to say. Theresa reached over and placed her hand carefully over his.</p>
<p>"But you know what? We had a good time that night, and I realized I wanted to see you again. Not because of the letters, but because of how you treated me. And everything just seemed to grow naturally from there. After that first meeting, nothing that happened between us was part of a plan. It just happened."</p>
<p>He sat quietly for a moment, looking at the letters. "Why didn't you tell me about them?" he asked.</p>
<p>"There were times when I wanted to, but... I don't know... I guess I convinced myself that it didn't matter how we met. The only thing that mattered was how well we got along." She paused, knowing there was more. "Besides, I didn't think you'd understand. I didn't want to lose you."</p>
<p>Theresa glanced away.</p>
<p>"Last night," she went on, "when you asked me to move, I didn't say yes right away because I was afraid of why you'd asked." She hesitated. "I needed to be sure you wanted me, Garrett. I needed to be sure you asked me because of us, and not because you were running from something. I guess I wanted you to convince me when I got back from the store. But you found these instead..."</p>
<p>She shrugged, speaking more softly now. "Deep down, I guess I knew it all along, but I wanted to believe that everything would work itself out."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>She didn't answer directly. "Garrett - it isn't that I don't think you love me, because I know you do. That's what makes this whole thing so hard. I know you love me, and I love you, too - and if the circumstances were different, perhaps we could get through all this. But right now, I don't think we can. I don't think you're ready yet."</p>
<p>Garrett felt as if he'd been punched in the stomach. She looked directly at him, meeting his eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm not blind, Garrett. I knew why you got so quiet sometimes when we weren't together. I knew why you wanted me to move down here."</p>
<p>"It was because I missed you," he said.</p>
<p>"That was part of it... but not all of it," Theresa said, pausing to blink back tears. Her voice began to crack. "It's also because of Catherine."</p>
<p>She wiped her eyes, fighting tears.</p>
<p>"When you first told me about her, I saw the way you looked... It was obvious that you still loved her. And last night - despite your anger - I saw the same look again. Even after all the time we've spent together, you're still not over her. And then... the things you said..." She took a deep, uneven breath. "You weren't angry simply because I found the letters, you were angry because you felt I threatened what you and Catherine shared - and still do."</p>
<p>Garrett looked away, hearing the echo of his father's accusation. Theresa touched his hand.</p>
<p>"You are who you are, Garrett. You're a man who loves deeply, but you're also a man who loves forever. No matter how much you love me, I don't think it's in you to ever forget her, and I can't live my life wondering whether I measure up to her."</p>
<p>"We can work on it," he began hoarsely. "I mean... I can work on it. I know it can be different -"</p>
<p>Theresa cut him off with a brief squeeze of his hand.</p>
<p>"I know you believe that, and part of me wants to believe it, too. If you put your arms around me now and begged me to stay, I'm sure I would, because you added something to my life that was lacking for a long time. And we'd go on again as we had been, both believing everything was okay... But it wouldn't be, don't you see? Because the next time we had an argument..." She stopped. "I can't compete with her. And as much as I want it to go on, I can't let it, because you won't let it."</p>
<p>"But I love you."</p>
<p>She smiled gently. Letting go of his hand, she reached up and softly caressed his cheek. "I love you, too, Garrett. But sometimes love isn't enough."</p>
<p>Garrett was quiet when she finished; his face was pale. In the long silence between them, Theresa began to cry.</p>
<p>Leaning toward her, he put his arm around her and held her. He rested his cheek against her hair as she buried her face in his chest. Her body was shaking as she cried into him. It was a long time before Theresa wiped her cheeks and pulled away. They looked at each other; Garrett's eyes expressed a mute request. She shook her head.</p>
<p>"I can't stay, Garrett. As much as we both want me to, I can't."</p>
<p>The words hit hard. Garrett's head suddenly felt dizzy.</p>
<p>"No..." he said brokenly.</p>
<p>Theresa stood, knowing she had to leave. Outside, thunder boomed loudly. Seconds later a light, misty rain began to fall.</p>
<p>"I have to go."</p>
<p>She slipped her purse over her shoulder and started for the front door. For a moment, Garrett was too shocked to move.</p>
<p>Finally, he rose from his seat and followed her out the door. The rain was beginning to fall steadily now. Her rental car was parked in the driveway. Garrett watched as she opened the car door, unable to think of anything to say.</p>
<p>In the driver's seat, she fumbled with the key for a moment, and then put it in the ignition. She forced a weak smile as she shut the door. Despite the rain, she rolled down the window to see him more clearly. They stared at each other.</p>
<p>His expression as he looked at her cut through all her defenses. For just a moment, she wanted to take everything back. She wanted to tell him that she didn't mean what she had said, that she still loved him, that it shouldn't end this way. It would be easy to do that; it would feel so right...</p>
<p>But no matter how much she wanted to, she couldn't force herself to say the words.</p>
<p>He took a step toward the car. Theresa shook her head to stop him. This was already painful enough.</p>
<p>"I'll miss you, Garrett," she said beneath her breath, uncertain whether he could even hear her.</p>
<p>The rain began to fall harder: the thicker, colder drops of a winter storm.</p>
<p>Garrett stood, frozen. "Please," he said, "don't leave." His voice was low, almost obscured by the sound of the rain.</p>
<p>She didn't answer.</p>
<p>Knowing she would start to cry again if she stayed any longer, she rolled up the window. Looking over her shoulder, she began to back out of the drive. In a moment, the car was on the street, ready to roll.</p>
<p>Garrett felt his last chance slipping away. "Theresa," he shouted, "wait!"</p>
<p>With the rain coming down steadily, she didn't hear him. The car was already past the house. Garrett ran to the end of the drive, waving his arms to get her attention. She didn't notice.</p>
<p>"Theresa!" he shouted again. He was in the middle of the road now, running behind the car. Garrett knew she was watching him in the rearview mirror. There's still a chance...</p>
<p>The car was picking up speed. Garrett kept running behind I he car, chasing it as it made its way down the street. He watched as the car moved farther into the distance, becoming smaller with each passing moment, but he kept on going. The rain was making it difficult for him to see.</p>
<p>Finally, he slowed to a jog, and then stopped. His shirt clung to his skin While the rain came down around him, he stood in the middle of the road, watching as her car turned the corner and vanished from sight.</p>
<p>Still, he didn't move. He stayed in the middle of the road for a long time, trying to catch his breath, hoping she would turn around and come back to him.</p>
<p>She was gone.</p>
<p>Garrett suddenly realized he'd never felt so alone.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the airplane, Theresa was looking out the window. She watched the rain coming down in blowing sheets.</p>
<p>As the plane rose higher, Theresa watched as Wilmington came into view. She could see the empty beaches as they passed over them... the piers... the marina...</p>
<p>The plane started to make its turn, heading for home. From her window, all she could see was the ocean now, the same ocean that had brought them together.</p>
<p>Behind the heavy clouds, the sun was going down, drifting toward the horizon.</p>
<p>She put her hand against the glass and touched it gently, imagining the feel of his hand once more.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," she whispered.</p>
<p>Silently she began to cry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>
<p>Winter arrived early the following year. Theresa was sitting on the beach near the spot where she'd first discovered the bottle. The cold ocean breezes grew stronger since she'd arrived this morning. Theresa knew the storm was finally getting close.</p>
<p>She'd been out here for most of the day, reliving their relationship up until the day they'd said good-bye. For the past year she'd been haunted by his expression as he stood in the driveway, by the reflection of him in her rearview mirror chasing her car as she drove away. Leaving him then had been the hardest thing she'd ever done. Often she dreamed of turning back the clock and living that day over.</p>
<p>Finally she stood. In silence, she started walking along the shore, wishing he were with her. He would enjoy a quiet, misty day like this, and she imagined him walking beside her as she looked toward the horizon.</p>
<p>Despite herself, she felt her thoughts returning to the days immediately following their last good-bye. We spend so much time making up for things we failed to say, she thought. If only, she began for the thousandth time, and the images of those days were beginning to flash behind her eyes like a slide show she was powerless to stop.</p>
<p>If only...</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After arriving back in Boston, Theresa had picked up Kevin on the way home from the airport. Kevin, who'd spent the day at a friend's house, excitedly recounted the movie he'd seen, oblivious of the fact that his mother was barely listening. When they got home she ordered a pizza, and they ate in the living room with the television on. When they finished, she surprised Kevin by asking him to sit with her for a while instead of doing his homework. As he rested against her quietly on the couch, he occasionally sent her an anxious glance, but she merely stroked his hair and smiled at him abstractedly, as if she were somewhere far away.</p>
<p>Later, after Kevin had gone to bed and she knew he'd alien asleep, she slipped on some soft pajamas and poured herself a glass of wine. On her way back to the bedroom, she turned off the answering machine by the phone.</p>
<p>On Monday, she had a long lunch with Deanna and told her everything that had happened. She tried to sound strong. Deanna was listening thoughtfully and barely speaking.</p>
<p>"It's for the best," Theresa said resolutely when she finished. "I'm okay with this." Deanna gazed at her searchingly; her eyes were full of compassion. But she said nothing, only nodding at Theresa's brave claims.</p>
<p>For the next few days, Theresa did her best to avoid thinking about him. Working on her column was comforting. Concentrating on research took all the mental energy she had. Dan Mandel had turned out to be everything Deanna promised it would, and Theresa approached her work with renewed enthusiasm, preparing two or three columns a day, faster than she'd ever written them before.</p>
<p>She cleaned the house from top to bottom during the next few evenings - scrubbing the floor, cleaning the refrigerator, vacuuming and dusting the apartment, rearranging the closets. Nothing was left untouched. She even sorted through her drawers for clothes that she didn't wear anymore, with the plan of donating them to charity.</p>
<p>That weekend she and Kevin went to see the New England Patriots play the Chicago Bears. Afterward, when they went to dinner, Theresa reluctantly told Kevin that she and Garrett wouldn't be seeing each other anymore.</p>
<p>"Mom, did something happen when you went to see Garrett last time? Did he do something that made you mad?"</p>
<p>"No," she answered softly, "he didn't." She hesitated before glancing away. "It just wasn't meant to be."</p>
<p>The following week she was working at her computer when the phone rang.</p>
<p>"Is this Theresa?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is," she answered, not recognizing the voice.</p>
<p>"This is Jeb Blake... Garrett's father. I know this is going to sound strange, but I'd like to talk to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, hi," she stammered. "Um... I've got a few minutes now."</p>
<p>He paused. "I'd like to talk to you in person, if it's possible. It's not something I'd be comfortable with over the phone."</p>
<p>"Can I ask what it's about?"</p>
<p>"It's about Garrett," he said quietly. "I know it's asking a lot, but do you think you could fly down here? I wouldn't ask if it weren't important."</p>
<p>Finally agreeing to go, Theresa left work and went to Kevin's school. After picking him up early, she dropped him off with a friend she could trust, explaining that she was probably going to be gone a few days. Kevin tried to ask her about her sudden trip, but her odd, distracted behavior made it clear that her reasons would be explained later.</p>
<p>"Say hi for me," he said, kissing her good-bye.</p>
<p>Theresa only nodded, then went to the airport and caught the first flight she could. Once in Wilmington, she went directly to Garrett's house, where Jeb was waiting for her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"I'm glad you could come," Jeb said as soon as she'd arrived.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" she asked, scanning the house curiously for signs of Garrett's presence.</p>
<p>Jeb looked older than she remembered. Leading her to the kitchen table, he pulled out the chair so she could sit with him. Speaking softly, he began with what he knew.</p>
<p>"From what I could gather from talking to different people," he said quietly, "Garrett took Happenstance out later than usual..."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was simply something he had to do. Garrett knew the dark, heavy clouds on the horizon foretold a coming storm. They seemed far enough away, however, to give him the time he needed. Besides, he was only going out a few miles.</p>
<p>For three years, he'd taken the same route whenever he went out, driven by instinct and memories of Catherine. It had been her idea to sail directly east that night, the first night Happenstance was ready. In her imagination, they were sailing to Europe, a place she'd always wanted to go. But, of course, they never made it to Europe.</p>
<p>It was one of his biggest regrets. After a couple of years of saving, they'd had the money to go, but in the end, they'd used the money to buy the shop. When she realized the responsibility of the business would never leave them with enough time to go, her dream eventually began to fade. After a while, she seldom mentioned Europe at all.</p>
<p>The night they first took Happenstance out, however, he knew her dream was still alive. She stood on the bow, looking far into the distance, holding Garrett's hand. "Will we ever go?" she asked him gently, and it was that vision of her he always remembered: her hair was flowing in the wind, and her expression was radiant and hopeful, like that of an angel.</p>
<p>"Yes," he promised her, "as soon as we have the time."</p>
<p>Less than a year later, while pregnant with their child, Catherine died in the hospital with Garrett at her side.</p>
<p>Later, when the dreams began, he didn't know what to do. For a while, he tried to push his tormented feelings away. Then in a fit of desperation one morning, he tried to find relief by putting his feelings into words. He wrote quickly, without pausing, and the first letter was almost five pages long. He carried the finished letter with him when he went sailing later that day, and reading it again suddenly gave him an idea. Because the Gulf Stream, which flowed northward up the coast of the United States, eventually turned east once it reached the cooler waters of the Atlantic, with a little luck a bottle could drift to Europe and wash up on the foreign soil she had always wanted to visit. His decision was made; he sealed the letter in a bottle and threw it overboard with the hopes of somehow keeping the promise he'd made. It became a pattern he would never break.</p>
<p>Since then he'd written sixteen more letters - seventeen, if you counted the one he had with him now. As he stood at the wheel, gliding the boat directly eastward, he absently touched the bottle nestled in his coat pocket. He had written it this morning, as soon as he had risen.</p>
<p>The sky was beginning to turn leaden, but Garrett steered onward, toward the horizon. Beside him, the radio crackled with warnings of the coming storm. After a moment's hesitation, he turned it off and evaluated the sky. He still had time, he decided.</p>
<p>After writing this letter to Catherine, he had written a second one as well. That one, he'd already taken care of. Because of the second letter, though, he knew he had to send Catherine's letter today. From the reports he'd seen on television, it didn't look as if he'd be able to get out again for at least a week, and that was too long to wait. He'd already be gone by then.</p>
<p>Of all the letters he'd written to her, he wanted this one to make it to Europe most of all. He had decided that it would be the last one he'd ever send.</p>
<p>On the horizon, the clouds looked threatening. He pulled on his raincoat and buttoned it up. When the rains came, he hoped it would protect him for at least a little while.</p>
<p>Happenstance began to bob as she moved farther out to sea. He held the wheel with both hands, keeping her as steady as he could.</p>
<p>Overhead, the clouds continued to thicken, rolling and twisting into new shapes. Light rain began to fall. Garrett looked upward, knowing it was just beginning. "Just a few more minutes," he muttered under his breath. He needed just a few more minutes...</p>
<p>Lightning flashed across the sky; the rain continued to fall. The sun dropped lower, quickly lowering the air temperature. Ten minutes later the rain began to fall harder and colder.</p>
<p>Damn! He was running out of time, but he still wasn't there.</p>
<p>He had to drop the bottle now, even though he wasn't as far out as he wanted to be. But he couldn't risk going out any farther.</p>
<p>He grasped the now shuddering wheel with one hand as he reached into his jacket and removed the bottle. He pressed on the cork to make sure it was wedged in tightly, and then held up the bottle. He could see the letter inside, rolled tightly.</p>
<p>Staring at it, he felt a sense of completion, as if a long journey had finally come to an end.</p>
<p>"Thank you," he whispered.</p>
<p>He threw the bottle as far as he could and watched it fly, losing it only when it hit the water. It was done.</p>
<p>Now, to turn the boat around.</p>
<p>At that moment, two bolts of lightning split the sky simultaneously.</p>
<p>The storm was gaining speed and strength, expanding like a balloon, coming directly toward him.</p>
<p>He switched on the radio just in time to hear a small-craft advisory. The broadcast described the rapidly changing weather patterns. "Repeat... small-craft advisory... dangerous winds forming, heavy rain expected."</p>
<p>The storm was gathering steam.</p>
<p>With the temperature dropping quickly, the winds had picked up dangerously. He leaned into the wheel.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>He realized suddenly that the rising waves were lifting the stern out of the water, not allowing the rudder to respond. The boat seemed frozen in the wrong direction. He rode another wave and the hull slapped hard against the water, with the bow of the boat nearly going under.</p>
<p>"Come on... catch," he whispered. This was taking too long. The sky was growing blacker by the minute.</p>
<p>A minute later the rudder finally caught and the boat began to turn...</p>
<p>Slowly... slowly... The boat was still leaning too far to its side...</p>
<p>With growing horror, he watched the ocean rise around him to form a roaring, giant swell that was headed straight for him.</p>
<p>He wasn't going to make it.</p>
<p>Water flooded onto the deck.</p>
<p>The boat struggled to stay upright in the blasting winds, actively taking on water now. For almost a minute, it poured onto the deck with the force of a raging river. Then the winds suddenly decreased for a moment, and miraculously Happenstance began to right itself. The rudder caught again and Garrett turned the wheel hard, knowing he had to rotate the boat quickly.</p>
<p>The radio crackled. "Repeat... small-craft advisory... winds expected to reach forty knots... repeat... winds at forty knots, gusting to fifty..."</p>
<p>Garrett knew he was in danger. There was no way he could control Happenstance in winds that strong.</p>
<p>The boat continued to make its turn, battling the extra weight and the savage ocean swells. The water at his feet was almost six inches deep now.</p>
<p>The wind suddenly began to blow from the opposite direction, rocking Happenstance like a toy. Just when the boat was most vulnerable, a large swell crashed against the hull. The mast sank lower, pointing toward the ocean.</p>
<p>Then the wave smashed against the boat with terrible finality, forcing Happenstance onto her side. She was lost. Garrett clung to the wheel, knowing if he let go, he'd be swept out to sea.</p>
<p>Happenstance began taking on water rapidly.</p>
<p>He had to get to the emergency kit, which included a raft - it was his only chance. Garrett made his way toward the cabin door, holding on to anything he could, fighting the blinding rain, fighting for his life.</p>
<p>Lightning and thunder again, almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>He finally reached the door and gripped the handle. It wouldn't move. Desperate, he pulled again. When it cracked open, water began to flood inside, and he suddenly realized he'd made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>The ocean rushed in. Garrett immediately saw that the kit was already underwater. There was nothing, he realized finally, to prevent the boat from sinking.</p>
<p>Panicked, he fought to shut the cabin door, but the rush of water made it impossible. Happenstance began to sink quickly. In seconds, half the hull was flooded. His mind suddenly clicked again.</p>
<p>Life jackets...</p>
<p>They were located under the seats near the stern.</p>
<p>He looked. They were still above water.</p>
<p>Fighting toward the seats, he placed hand over hand, straining against the weight of the waves and his own muscles. Halfway there, the ocean reached his neck and the senselessness of the situation finally hit him.</p>
<p>He wasn't going to make it.</p>
<p>The water was up to his chin when he finally stopped trying. Looking upward, with his body exhausted, he still refused to believe that it would end this way.</p>
<p>He let go of the side rail and began to swim away from the boat. His coat and shoes dragged heavily in the water. He was rising with the swells as he watched Happenstance finally slip beneath the ocean. Then, with cold and exhaustion beginning to numb his senses, he turned and began the slow, impossible swim to shore.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theresa sat with Jeb at the table. He had taken a long time to tell her what he knew.</p>
<p>Later, Theresa would recall that as she listened to his story, it was not with a sense of fear as much as it was one of curiosity. She knew that Garrett had survived. He was an expert sailor, an even better swimmer. He was too careful, too vital, to be beaten by something like this. If anyone could make it, it would be he.</p>
<p>She reached across the table to Jeb, confused. "I don't understand... Why did he take the boat out if he knew there was a storm coming?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said quietly. He couldn't meet her eyes.</p>
<p>"Did he say anything to you before he went out?"</p>
<p>Jeb shook his head. He was pale; his eyes were downcast as if hiding something. Absently Theresa looked around the kitchen. Everything was tidy, as if it had been cleaned moments before she arrived.</p>
<p>"I don't understand - he's all right, isn't he?"</p>
<p>"Theresa," Jeb finally said with tears forming in his eyes, "they found him yesterday morning."</p>
<p>"Is he in the hospital?"</p>
<p>"No," he said quietly.</p>
<p>"Then where is he?" she asked, refusing to acknowledge what she somehow knew.</p>
<p>Jeb didn't answer.</p>
<p>Her breathing suddenly became difficult. Beginning with her hands, her body started to tremble. Garrett! What happened? Why aren't you here? Jeb bowed his, head so she wouldn't see his tears, but she could hear his choking gasps.</p>
<p>"Theresa..." he said, trailing off.</p>
<p>"Where is he?" she demanded, leaping to her feet. She heard the chair clatter to the floor behind her as if from a very great distance.</p>
<p>Jeb stared up at her silently. Then, with a single deliberate motion, he wiped the tears with the back of his hand. "They found his body yesterday morning."</p>
<p>She felt her chest tighten as if she were suffocating. "He's gone, Theresa."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the beach where it had all begun, Theresa allowed herself to remember the events from one year earlier.</p>
<p>They had buried him next to Catherine, in a small cemetery near his home. Jeb and Theresa stood together at the graveside service, surrounded by the people whose lives Garrett had touched - friends from high school, former diving students, employees from the shop. It was a simple ceremony.</p>
<p>The wake was held at Garrett's house. One by one, people came through, sharing memories. When the last few left, and Jeb and Theresa were alone, Jeb pulled a box from the closet and asked her to sit with him while they looked through it together.</p>
<p>In the box were hundreds of photographs. Over the next few hours she watched Garrett's childhood and adolescence unfold - all the missing pieces of his life that she had only imagined. There were dozens of photographs of Catherine. At first Jeb seemed uncomfortable when she saw them, but strangely, they didn't really affect her. She felt neither sadness nor anger because of them. They were simply a part of another time in his life.</p>
<p>The following morning he handed her an envelope. Opening it, she saw that he'd given her a number of Garrett's photos. With the pictures were the three letters that had first enabled Theresa and Garrett to come together.</p>
<p>"I think he would want you to have these." Too choked up to respond, she nodded a silent thank-you.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theresa couldn't remember much about her first few days back in Boston. She recalled that Deanna was waiting for her at the airport when her plane touched down. After taking one look at her, Deanna immediately called her husband, instructing him to bring some clothes to Theresa's because she planned to stay with her for a few days. Theresa spent most of the time in bed, not even bothering to get up when Kevin came home from school.</p>
<p>"Is my mom ever going to be okay?" Kevin asked.</p>
<p>"She just needs a little time, Kevin," Deanna answered. "I know it's hard for you, too, but it's going to be okay."</p>
<p>Theresa's dreams, when she could remember them, were fragmented and disorienting. Surprisingly, Garrett never appeared in them at all. She didn't know if that was an omen of sorts or even if she should attach any meaning to it. In her daze, she found it difficult to think about anything clearly, and she went to bed early and remained there, cocooned in the soothing darkness for as long as she could.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the beach at Cape Cod, one year later, she reflected without bitterness on the turn of events that had led her to this place. Ready at last, Theresa reached in her bag. After removing the object she had brought with her, she stared at it, reliving the hour in which her answer had finally come. Unlike her recollection of the days immediately following her return to Boston, this memory was still unshakably clear.</p>
<p>After Deanna had left, Theresa had tried to reestablish a routine of sorts. In her confusion over the last week, she'd ignored the aspects of life that nonetheless had gone on. While Deanna had helped with Kevin and kept the house up, she'd simply piled the mail that accumulated in the corner of the dining room. After dinner one night while Kevin was at the movies, Theresa absently began to sort through the pile.</p>
<p>There were a few dozen letters, three magazines, and two packages. One package she recognized as an item she'd ordered from a catalog for Kevin's birthday. The second, though, was wrapped in plain brown paper without a return address.</p>
<p>This second package was long and rectangular, sealed with extra tape. There were two "Fragile" stickers - one near the address and the other on the opposite side of the box - and another sticker that said "Handle with Care." Curious, she decided to open it first.</p>
<p>It was then that she saw the postmark from Wilmington, North Carolina, dated from two weeks before. Quickly she scanned the address on the front.</p>
<p>It was Garrett's handwriting.</p>
<p>"No..." She set the package down; her stomach was suddenly tight.</p>
<p>She found a pair of scissors in the drawer and shakily began to cut the tape. She already knew what she'd find inside.</p>
<p>After lifting out the object and checking the rest of the package to make sure nothing was still inside, she carefully loosened the surrounding bubble wrap. It was taped tightly at the top and bottom, and she was forced to use the scissors again. Finally, she set the object on her desk and stared at it for a long moment, unable to move. When she lifted it into better light, she saw her own reflection.</p>
<p>The bottle was corked, and the rolled-up letter inside stood on its end. After removing the cork - he'd corked it only loosely - she tipped it upside-down, and the letter spilled out easily.</p>
<p>In the top right corner was a picture of an old ship.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Dear Theresa,</p>
<p>Can you forgive me?</p>
<p>In a world that I seldom understand, there are winds of destiny that blow when we least expect them. The winds cannot be denied, bringing a future that is impossible to ignore. You, my darling, are the wind that I did not anticipate, the wind that has gusted more strongly than I ever imagined possible. You are my destiny.</p>
<p>I was wrong, so wrong, to ignore what was obvious, and I beg your forgiveness. Like a cautious traveler, I tried to protect myself from the wind and lost my soul instead. I was a fool to ignore my destiny, but even fools have feelings, and I've come to realize that you are the most important thing that I have in this world.</p>
<p>I know I am not perfect. I've made more mistakes in the past few months than some make in a lifetime. I was wrong to act as I did when I found the letters, just as I was wrong to hide the truth about what I was going through with respect to my past. But most of all, I was wrong to deny what was obvious in my heart: that I can't go on without you.</p>
<p>You were right about everything. When we sat in my kitchen, I tried to deny the things you were saying, even though I knew they were true. Like a man who gazes only backward on a trip across the country, I ignored what lay ahead. I missed the beauty of a coming sunrise, the wonder of anticipation that makes life worthwhile. It was wrong of me to do that, and I wish I had come to understand that sooner.</p>
<p>Now, though, with my gaze fixed toward the future, I see your face and hear your voice, certain that this is the path I must follow. It is my deepest wish that you give me one more chance. I'm hoping that this bottle will work its magic, as it did once before, and somehow bring us back together.</p>
<p>For the first few days after you left, I wanted to believe that I could go on as I always had. But I couldn't. Every time I watched the sun go down, I thought of you. Every time I walked by the phone, I yearned to call. Even when I went sailing, I could only think of you and the wonderful times we had. I knew in my heart that my life would never be the same again. I wanted you back, more than I imagined possible, yet whenever I conjured you up, I kept hearing your words in our last conversation. No matter how much I loved you, I knew it wasn't going to be possible unless we - both of us - were sure I would devote myself fully to the path that lay ahead. I continued to be troubled by these thoughts until late last night when the answer finally came to me. Hopefully, after I tell you about it, it will mean as much to you as it did to me. In my dream, I saw myself on the beach with Catherine, in the same spot I took you after our lunch at Hank's. It was bright in the sun. As we walked alongside each other, she listened intently as I told her about you, about us, about the wonderful times we shared. Finally, after some hesitation, I admitted that I loved you, but that I felt guilty about it. She said nothing right away but simply kept walking until she finally turned to me and asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>"Because of you."</p>
<p>Upon hearing my answer, she smiled at me. "Oh. Garrett," she finally said as she gently touched my face, "who do you think it was that brought the bottle to her?"</p>
<p>When I woke, I felt empty and alone. The dream did not comfort me. Rather, it made me ache inside because of what I had done to us, and I began to cry. When I finally pulled myself together, I knew what I had to do. With shaking hand, I wrote two letters: the one you're holding in your hand right now, and one to Catherine, in which I finally said my good-bye. Today, I'm taking Happenstance out to send it to her. It will be my last letter - Catherine, in her own way, has told me to go on, and I have chosen to listen. Not only to her words, but also to my heart that led me back to you.</p>
<p>Oh, Theresa, I am sorry, so very sorry, that I ever hurt you. I am coming to Boston next week with the hope that you find a way to forgive me. Maybe I'm too late now. I don't know.</p>
<p>Theresa, I love you and always will. I am tired of being alone. I see children crying and laughing as they play in the sand, and I realize I want to have children with you. I want to watch Kevin as he grows into a man. I want to hold your hand and see you cry when he finally takes a bride, and I want to kiss you when his dreams come true. I will move to Boston if you ask because I cannot go on this way. I am sick and sad without you. As I sit here in the kitchen, I am praying that you will let me come back to you, this time forever.</p>
<p>Garrett</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was dusk now, and the gray sky was turning dark quickly. Though she'd read the letter a thousand times, it still aroused the same feelings she'd had when she'd first read it. For the past year, those feelings had followed her every waking moment.</p>
<p>Sitting on the beach, she tried once again to imagine him as he wrote the letter. She ran her finger across the words, tracing the page lightly, knowing his hand had been there before. Fighting back tears, she studied the letter, as she always did after reading it. Six words had been crossed out, and she looked at those especially closely, wondering what he'd intended to say. As always, she couldn't tell. Toward the bottom of the page, she noticed, his handwriting was hard to read, as if he'd been gripping the pen tightly.</p>
<p>When she was finished, she rolled up the letter again. She put it back into the bottle and set it off to one side, next to the bag. She knew that when she got home, she would place it back on her bureau, where she always kept it. At night, when the glow of streetlights slanted through her room, the bottle gleamed in the darkness and was usually the last thing she saw before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Next, she reached for the pictures Jeb had given her. She remembered that after she returned from Boston, she'd looked through them one by one. When her hands began to tremble, she had put them in her drawer and never looked at them again</p>
<p>But now she thumbed through them, finding the one that had been taken on the back porch. Holding it in front of her, she remembered everything about him - the way he looked and moved, his easy smile, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. Perhaps tomorrow, she told herself, she would take in the negative and have another one made, that she could set on her nightstand, the same way he had with Catherine's picture. Then she smiled sadly, realizing even now that she wouldn't go through with it. The photos would go back into her drawer where they had been before. It would hurt too much to see his face every day, and she wasn't ready for that yet.</p>
<p>Since the funeral, she'd kept in contact with Jeb, calling now and then to see how he was doing. The first time she called, she had explained to him what she had discovered about why Garrett had taken Happenstance out that day.</p>
<p>In July, Theresa and Kevin flew to Florida and went scuba diving in the Keys. The water there, as in North Carolina, was warm, though much clearer. They spent eight days there, diving every morning and relaxing on the beach in the afternoon. On their way back to Boston, they both decided they would do it again the following year. For his birthday, Kevin asked for a subscription to a diving magazine. Ironically, the first issue included a story about the shipwrecks off the North Carolina coast, including the one in shallow water they had visited with Garrett.</p>
<p>Though she'd been asked, she hadn't dated anyone since Garrett's death. Now and then, she overheard her colleagues' whispers: "I don't understand why she's giving up," or, "She's still young and attractive." Others, who were more understanding, simply observed that she'd eventually recover, in her own time.</p>
<p>It was a phone call from Jeb three weeks ago that had led her back to Cape Cod. When she listened to his gentle voice, quietly suggesting that it was time to move on, the walls she'd built finally began to collapse. She cried for most of the night, but the following morning she knew what she had to do. She made the arrangements to return here. And then her healing finally began.</p>
<p>As she stood on the beach, she wondered if anyone could see her. She glanced from side to side, but it was deserted. She watched the ocean for a long time, thinking of Garrett, until she heard the growl of thunder echo through the winter sky.</p>
<p>The wind picked up, and she felt her mind drift with it. Why, she wondered, had it ended the way it had? She didn't know. Another gust and she felt him beside her, brushing the hair from her face. He had done that when they said good. It is late bye, and she felt his touch once more. There were so many things that she wished she could change about that day, so many regrets...</p>
<p>Now, alone with her thoughts, she loved him. She would always love him. She'd known it from the moment she saw him on the docks, and she knew it now. Neither the passage of time nor his death could change the way she felt. She closed her eyes, whispering to him as she did so.</p>
<p>"I miss you, Garrett Blake," she said softly. And for a moment, she imagined he'd somehow heard her, because the wind suddenly died and the air became still.</p>
<p>The first few raindrops were beginning to fall by the time she uncorked the simple clear bottle she was holding so tightly and removed the letter she had written to him yesterday, the letter she had come to send. After unrolling it, she held it before her, the same way she held the first letter she'd ever found. The little light that remained was barely enough for her to see the words, but she knew them all by heart, anyway. Her hands shook slightly as she began reading.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>My Darling,</p>
<p>One year has passed since I sat with your father in the kitchen. It is late at night and though the words are coming hard to me, I can't escape the feeling that it's time that I finally answer our question.</p>
<p>Of course, I forgive you. I forgive you now, and I forgave you the moment I read your letter. In my heart, I had no other choice. Though I'm still grieving over what might have been, I find myself thankful that you came into my life for even a short period of time. In the beginning, I'd assumed that we were somehow brought together to help you through your time of grief. Yet now, one year later, I've come to believe that it was the other way around.</p>
<p>Ironically, I am in the same position you were, the first time we met. As I write, I am struggling with the ghost of someone I loved and lost. I now understand more fully the difficulties you were going through, and I realize how painful it was for you to move on. Sometimes my grief is overwhelming, and even though I understand that we will never see each other again, there is a part of me that wants to hold on to you forever. It would be easy for me to do that because loving someone else might diminish my memories of you. Yet, this is the paradox: even though I miss you greatly, it's because of you that I don't dread the future. Because you were able to fall in love with me, you have given me hope, my darling. You taught me that it's possible to move forward in life, no matter how terrible your grief. And in your own way, you've made me believe that true love cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Right now, I don't think I'm ready, but this is my choice. Because of you, I am hopeful that there will come a day when my sadness is replaced by something beautiful. Because of you, I have the strength to go on.</p>
<p>I will sense your presence everywhere. When I listen to the ocean, it will be your whispers; when I see a dazzling sunset, it will be your image in the sky. You are not gone forever, no matter who comes into my life. You are standing with God, alongside my soul, helping to guide me toward a future that I cannot predict.</p>
<p>I don't say good-bye, my darling, I say thank you. Thank you for coming into my life and giving me joy, thank you for loving me and receiving my love in return. Thank you for the memories I will keep forever. But most of all, thank you for showing me that there will come a time when I can eventually let you go.</p>
<p>I love you,</p>
<p>T</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>After reading the letter for the last time, Theresa rolled it up and sealed it in the bottle. She turned it over a few times, knowing that her journey had come full circle. Finally, when she knew she could wait no longer, she threw it out as far as she could.</p>
<p>It was then that a strong wind picked up and the fog began to part. Theresa stood in silence and stared at the bottle as it began to float out to sea. And even though she knew it was impossible, she imagined that the bottle would never drift ashore. It would travel the world forever, drifting by faraway places she herself would never see.</p>
<p>When the bottle vanished from sight a few minutes later, she started back to the car. Walking in silence in the rain, Theresa smiled softly. She didn't know when or where or if it would ever turn up, but it didn't really matter. Somehow she knew that Garrett would get the message.</p>
