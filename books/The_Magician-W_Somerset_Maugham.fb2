        <annotation><p>A gentleman named Oliver Haddo is in the center of the plot. This man devotes his life not to a banal profession, but to the study of magic and black arts. Oliver is sure that he possesses outstanding magical abilities and does not doubt the existence of magic. Still such behaviour looks strange in England of this period. People around doubt sanity of Mr. Haddo. Oliver falls in love with the wife of a young surgeon Arthur. Arthur and Margaret are progressive people. They believe exclusively in science. Magic is just a superstition for them. But Oliver is not satisfied with such views. He is going to ask dark magic for help. He will prove to Margaret that he is worth her attention. What will win in the end? Progress or ancient dark beliefs?</p></annotation>

<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
<p>Arthur Burdon and Dr Porhoet walked in silence. Arthur had just arrived in Paris. He was a surgeon at St Luke's hospital, and had come to study the methods of the French doctors; but the real object of his visit to Paris was certainly to see Margaret Dauncey.</p>
<p>He looked upon himself as a happy man. He loved Margaret with all his heart and he was sure of her affection for him. It was impossible that anything could disturb the pleasant life they had planned together.</p>
<p>"We're going to fix the date of our marriage now," Arthur remarked to Dr Porhoet. "I'm buying furniture already."</p>
<p>"I think only English people could behave as oddly as you in postponing your marriage without any reason for two years," replied the doctor.</p>
<p>"You see, Margaret was ten when I first saw her, and only seventeen when I asked her to marry me. She seemed hardly ready for marriage. She was still growing. We loved each other and we had a long time before us. We could wait."</p>
<p>At that moment a man walked past them, a big stout fellow, dressed in a bright check suit. He gravely took off his hat and greeted Dr Porhoet. The doctor smiled and returned the salutation.</p>
<p>"Who is your fat friend?" asked Arthur.</p>
<p>"He is an Englishman too. His name is Oliver Haddo."</p>
<p>"An artist?" asked Arthur in the scornful tone in which he spoke of those whose work was not so practical as his own.</p>
<p>"Not exactly. I met him some time ago by chance. When I was collecting the material for my little book on the old alchemists I read a great deal in the library of the "Arsenal", which as you may know is rich in works dealing with the occult sciences. One day I was studying some question on which it seemed impossible to find any authorities. The librarian could not help me, and I wanted to give up the search, when this person brought me the book I needed. I was very grateful to the stranger. We left together that afternoon, and our common studies gave a theme of conversation. I found that his knowledge was extraordinarily wide, and he was able to give me information about works I had never even heard of."</p>
<p>"And what is he by profession?"</p>
<p>Doctor Porhoet smiled. "You know, Paris is full of odd people. It is the home for every kind of eccentricity. It seems incredible, but my friend Oliver Haddo says he is a magician. I think he is quite serious."</p>
<p>"Silly ass," answered Arthur scornfully.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
<p>Margaret Dauncey lived in an art studio near the Boulevard Montparnasse with Susie Boyd. That afternoon Arthur was coming to see them. The young women were expecting him. Susie was looking forward to the meeting with interest. She had heard a great deal about the young man, and knew about his romance with Margaret. For years Susie had led the monotonous life of a teacher in a school for young ladies, and when Margaret, who had been her pupil, told her of her intention to spend a couple of years in Paris to study art, Susie willingly agreed to accompany her. She had a great affection for Margaret and with almost maternal pride watched how each year added new charm to her extraordinary beauty. She was proud to think that she would hand over to Arthur Burdon a woman whose character she had helped to form.</p>
<p>Susie knew, partly from fragments of letters which Margaret read to her, partly from her conversation, how passionately he adored his bride, and she saw that Margaret loved him too. The story of their love was very romantic. Margaret was the daughter of a lawyer with whom Arthur had been friendly, and when he died, many years after his wife, Arthur became the girl's guardian. He tried to give her everything she could possibly want, and when at 17 she told him of her wish to go to Paris and learn drawing, he agreed at once. The preparations for the journey were made when Margaret discovered by chance that her father had died penniless and she had lived ever since at Arthur's expense. When she went to see him with tears in her eyes and told him what she knew, Arthur was very embarrassed.</p>
<p>"But why did you do it?" she asked him. "Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
<p>"I didn't want you to feel any obligation to me, and I wanted you to feel quite free."</p>
<p>She cried. She could not stop her tears.</p>
<p>"Don't be silly," he laughed. "You owe me nothing. I've done very little for you, and what I have done has given me a great deal of pleasure."</p>
<p>"I don't know how I can ever repay you."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't say that," he cried out. "It makes it much more difficult for me to say what I want to."</p>
<p>She looked at him quickly and reddened.</p>
<p>"I would do anything in the world for you," she said.</p>
<p>"I don't want you to be grateful to me, because I honed... I'd be able to ask you to marry me some day..."</p>
<p>Margaret laughed as she held out her hands.</p>
<p>"You must know that I've been wanting you to say that since I was ten."</p>
<p>She was quite willing to give up her idea of Paris and be married immediately, but Arthur had made up his mind they could not marry till she was nineteen. He asked her not to change her plans and to go to Paris, but suggested that she should not live alone; because of that she went to live with Susie.</p>
<p>Susie Boyd was thirty, but she looked older. She was not pretty, but her face was so kind, her sense of humour so attractive, that no one after ten minutes thought of her ugliness. Her taste was so good, her talent for dressing so remarkable, that she was able to make the most of herself. It was due to her influence that Margaret was dressed always in the latest fashion.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door, and Arthur came in.</p>
<p>"This is the fairy prince," said Margaret, leading him to her friend.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to see you to thank you for all you've done for Margaret," he smiled, taking Susie's hand.</p>
<p>While Margaret was preparing tea, his eyes followed her movements with a touching doglike devotion. Margaret felt that he was looking at her and turned round. Their eyes met and they stood some time gazing at each other silently.</p>
<p>"Don't be a pair of perfect idiots," exclaimed Susie gaily. "I'm dying for my tea."</p>
<p>The lovers laughed and blushed. Margaret smiled with happy pride. For all her good nature, Susie could not help feeling a pang of jealousy: for she was also capable of love, but no one had ever tried to find it. No one had ever whispered in her ear the charming nonsense that she read in books. She knew that she had no beauty to help her and she was not young any longer, but her instinct told her that she was made to be a good wife and the mother of children.</p>
<p>Her voice broke and she stopped in the middle of her happy chatter. She looked at Margaret and Arthur, but they were too preoccupied with each other to notice it.</p>
<p>"What a fool I am!" thought Susie.</p>
<p>When Margaret had closed the door on him she turned to her friend.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think of him?" she asked, smiling.</p>
<p>"You can't expect me to form a definite opinion of a man I've seen only for so short a time."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said Margaret.</p>
<p>Susie hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"You know, before I'd seen him I hoped with all my heart that he would make you happy. I was afraid. I knew he was much older than you. He was the first man you'd ever met. But now, when I saw him, I hope with all my heart that you'd make him happy. It's not you I'm frightened for now, but him."</p>
<p>Margaret did not answer; she could not understand what Susie meant.</p>
<p>"I don't think you can realise how awfully he may suffer. Be very careful, Margaret, and be very good to him, for you can make him more unhappy than any human being can be."</p>
<p>"Oh, but I want him to be happy," cried Margaret. "I'll do all I can to make him happy."</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears and her voice broke. Susie, with a little laugh that was half hysterical, kissed her.</p>
<p>"My dear, for Heaven's sake, don't cry. If he sees your eyes red, he'll never forgive me."</p>

<p>CHAPTER THREE</p>
<p>The Chien Noir where Susie Boyd and Margaret usually dined was the most charming restaurant in the quarter. The room was full when Arthur Burdon entered, but Margaret had kept him an empty seat between herself and Miss Boyd. Everyone was speaking at once, and a furious argument was going on about the post - impressionists.</p>
<p>Susie Boyd had just described everyone to Arthur when the door was flung open, and a large person entered. He threw off his cloak with a dramatic gesture.</p>
<p>"Here's somebody I don't know," said Susie.</p>
<p>"But I do. I saw him once," answered Burdon. He leaned over to Dr Porhoet, who was sitting opposite quietly eating his dinner. "Isn't it your magician?"</p>
<p>"Oliver Haddo," said Dr Porhoet with amazement.</p>
<p>The newcomer stood at the end of the room with all eyes upon him. He was a very tall and very fat man. He was not old, but looked older because of his obesity. His features were good, his mouth large with heavy bright red lips. He had the look of a very wicked, sensual priest. Dr Porhoet introduced him to Arthur, Susie and Margaret. He raised his eyes to her slowly, and she looked away, blushing as though she had been caught doing something unseemly. The eyes were the most unusual thing about him. They were not large, but very pale blue and they looked at you in a way that made you feel extremely uncomfortable. Their gaze remained parallel, not converging. It gave the impression that he was looking straight through you. Another strange thing about him was the impossibility of telling whether he was serious. There was a mockery in that odd glance, a sardonic smile upon the mouth, which made you hesitate how to take the shocking words with which he addressed everybody.</p>
<p>His presence caused an odd atmosphere. One by one all the visitors of the restaurant got up and left. Haddo stopped an American sculptor.</p>
<p>"You have modelled lions at the Jardin des Plantes, my dear Clayton. Have you ever hunted them in Africa?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't."</p>
<p>"Then you have not seen the jackal, gnawing at a dead antelope, run away in terror when the King of Beasts come down to make his meal."</p>
<p>Clayton slammed the door behind him. Haddo was left with Margaret, Arthur Burdon, Dr Porhoet and Susie. He smiled quietly.</p>
<p>"By the way, are you a lion-hunter?" asked Susie. He turned to her.</p>
<p>"I have shot more lions than any man alive. No one can compare with me."</p>
<p>This statement, made with the greatest calm, caused a moment of silence. Margaret stared at him with amazement.</p>
<p>"You suffer from no false modesty," said Arthur.</p>
<p>"False modesty is a sign of ill-breeding, from which my birth fully protects me."</p>
<p>Dr Porhoet looked at him with a smile of irony.</p>
<p>"I hope Mr Haddo will use this opportunity to disclose to us the mystery of his birth and family. I have a suspicion that, like the immortal Cagliostro, he was born of unknown but noble parents, and educated secretly in Eastern palaces."</p>
<p>"My family has married into the most noble people in England and they were proud to give their daughters to my house."</p>
<p>"And the Eastern palaces in which your youth was spent, and the black slaves who served you, and the bearded sheikhs who taught you the secrets of black magic?" cried Dr Porhoet.</p>
<p>"I was educated at Eton, and I left Oxford in 1896."</p>
<p>"Those are facts which must be verified," said Arthur coldly.</p>
<p>Oliver's face turned red with anger. His strange blue eyes grew cold with hatred. Susie feared that he would make such an insulting reply that it would lead to quarrel.</p>
<p>"Well, if we really want to go to the fair we must set off," she said quickly.</p>
<p>They got up and went down the stairs and out into the street.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER FOUR</p>
<p>They walked down to the noisy, narrow street which led to the Boulevard Montparnasse. The fair to which they were going was held not more than a mile away, and Arthur took a cab. Susie noticed that Haddo, who was waiting for them to set off, put his hand on the horse's neck. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the animal began to tremble. The trembling passed through its body and down its limbs till it shook from head to foot. The animal seemed to be suffering not so much from pain, as from an extraordinary fear.</p>
<p>"Take your hand away, Mr Haddo," said Susie sharply.</p>
<p>He smiled and did as she told him. At the same moment the trembling began to decrease, and in a moment the poor animal was in its normal state.</p>
<p>"I wonder what the devil was the matter with it," said Arthur.</p>
<p>Oliver Haddo looked at him with his blue eyes that seemed to see right through people; and then, lifting his hat, walked away. Susie turned to Dr Porhoet.</p>
<p>"Do you think he could have made the horse tremble?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said Arthur.</p>
<p>"It occurred to me that he was playing some trick," said Dr Porhoet. "An odd thing happened once when he came to see me. I have two Persian cats, which are usually very quiet and well-behaved. They spend their days in front of my fire, meditating on the problems of metaphysics. But as soon as he came in they jumped, and their fur stood right on end. Then they began to run madly round the room, as though the victims of uncontrollable terror. I opened the door and they rushed out. I have never been able to understand what happened."</p>
<p>Margaret shuddered.</p>
<p>"I've never met a man who filled me with such antipathy," she said. "I don't know what there is about him that excites in me a sort of horror. I hope I shall never see him again."</p>
<p>"And as for me," answered Susie, "I would like to know more about him, because he interests me very much. Just think what a privilege it is to meet a man in the twentieth century who honestly believes in occultism."</p>
<p>"Since I have been occupied with these matters, I have met strange people," said Dr Porhoet quietly, "but I agree with Miss Boyd that Oliver Haddo is the most extraordinary. It is difficult to understand him. All I know is that he has travelled much and knows many languages. He has a wide knowledge of the literature of alchemy, and there is no book I have heard of, dealing with the black arts, which he does not know. My friend Arthur won't agree with me, but I must confess that it would not surprise me to learn that he possesses powers by which he is able to do things that seem miraculous."</p>
<p>Arthur did not answer as they arrived at the fair.</p>
<p>It was in full swing. The noise was deafening. Popular tunes were heard and merry-go-rounds were turning everywhere. The English party with Dr Porhoet had just entered when they saw Oliver Haddo. He was indifferent to the fact that they did not want his company. He attracted attention, for his appearance and his manners were eccentric, and Susie noticed that he was pleased to see people point him out to one another.</p>
<p>They walked on and suddenly came to a canvas tent on which was a picture of an Arab charming snake, and some words in Arabic.</p>
<p>"I'll buy tickets for you all," said Haddo.</p>
<p>They went inside and found themselves in a dirty tent, ill-lit by two lamps; a dozen stools were placed in a circle on the ground. The snake-charmer addressed them in bad English.</p>
<p>"My name Mohammed," he said. "Me show snakes. Wait and see. Snakes very venomous."</p>
<p>He was dressed in a long gabardine coat and its colour could hardly be seen for dirt. On his head was the national turban. From a bag that lay at one side of the tent the Arab drew a long, wriggling serpent. He placed it on the ground and waited a moment. Then he passed his hand over it; it became immediately stiff as a stick. Except that its eyes, the malignant eyes, were still open, there was no life in it. Then the Arab took a reedpipe and began to play a monotonous tune. The stiffness went away from the snake suddenly, it lifted its head and raised its long body till it stood almost on the tip of its tail. Then it began swaying slowly.</p>
<p>Margaret drew back in terror.</p>
<p>"You need not be frightened," said Arthur. "These people work only with animals whose fangs have been extracted."</p>
<p>Haddo looked at him before answering.</p>
<p>"This man is a snake-charmer because he is immune against the fangs of the most venomous snakes," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't think so," said Arthur. "I'd like to have a proof that these serpents are venomous."</p>
<p>Oliver turned to the charmer and spoke to him in Arabic. Then he answered Arthur.</p>
<p>"This man has a horned serpent which is the most dangerous of all Egyptian snakes."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Susie. Oliver Haddo smiled and did not answer. He stepped forward to the centre of the tent and fell on his knees. He uttered some Arabic words, which Dr Porhoet translated to the others.</p>
<p>A shudder went through the bag, and in a moment a head appeared. It was a viper of light grey colour, and over each eye was a horn.</p>
<p>Haddo seized the snake and opened its mouth. Immediately the reptile's teeth went deep into his hand. Arthur watched him for signs of pain, but he did not notice any. Haddo repeated a sentence in Arabic and the serpent fell to the ground. The blood flowed from Haddo's hand. Haddo spat upon the bleeding place three times, muttering words they could not hear. The bleeding stopped. He held out his hand for Arthur to look at.</p>
<p>Burdon was astonished, but he would not admit that there was anything strange in stopping the blood.</p>
<p>"You haven't yet shown that the snake was venomous."</p>
<p>"I have not finished yet," smiled Haddo. He spoke again to the Egyptian who rose to his feet and from a box took a white rabbit. Haddo put it in front of the homed snake. Before anyone could move, the snake came forward and struck the rabbit. The poor little animal gave a scream, a shudder went through it, and it fell dead.</p>
<p>Margaret sprang up with a cry.</p>
<p>"Oh, how cruel! How cruel!"</p>
<p>"Are you convinced now?" asked Haddo turning to Arthur.</p>
<p>"I am convinced that you are a charlatan," said Arthur sharply.</p>
<p>Haddo did not answer. A strange smile spread over his face, a smile that was even more terrifying than a grimace of rage.</p>
<p>Susie wanted to cry out, but she couldn't utter a sound. The smile passed away, and the face became once more passive.</p>
<p>The two women hurried to the doorway. They were frightened and disgusted. Oliver Haddo was left alone with the snake-charmer.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER FIVE</p>
<p>Susie could not get out of her mind the smile on Haddo's face that followed the first passionate look of deadly hatred. Her fantasy suggested various dark means by which Oliver Haddo might take revenge on his enemy, and she tried to warn Arthur. But he only laughed.</p>
<p>"What on earth do you suppose he can do? If he kills me he'll be hanged, and he won't be such a fool as to risk his head."</p>
<p>Margaret was glad that after the incident Oliver had not appeared in their company. She began to discuss with Arthur the date of their wedding. She was filled with delight at the thought of the happiness she would give him.</p>
<p>A day or two later Susie received a telegram. It ran as follows:</p>
<p>Please meet me at the Gare du Nord, 2.40. Nancy Clerk.</p>
<p>It was an old friend of hers, who was apparently arriving in Paris that afternoon. She had not seen Nancy for such a long time that it surprised her to receive this urgent message.</p>
<p>"I don't want to go," said Susie, "but I suppose I must meet her."</p>
<p>Margaret had a class that afternoon and after it she went home alone. As she walked through the courtyard she started nervously, for Oliver Haddo passed slowly by. He did not seem to see her. Suddenly he stopped, put his hand to his heart and fell to the ground. Margaret had to go up to him. Her heart beat violently. She looked down at Oliver, and he seemed to be dead. She forgot that she hated him. Instinctively she knelt down by his side and took his hand. He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, take me for one moment into the studio," he whispered. "I shall die in the street."</p>
<p>She could not refuse him. With the help of some people she raised him to his feet, and together they brought him to the studio. He sank heavily into an armchair.</p>
<p>"Shall I bring you some water?" asked Margaret.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry to cause you this trouble," he stammered. "I suffer from a disease of the heart, and sometimes I am very near death."</p>
<p>"I'm glad that I was able to help you," she said.</p>
<p>He seemed to be able to breathe more easily. She left him to himself for a while, so that he could regain his strength. She took up a book and began to read. Presently, without moving from his chair, he spoke.</p>
<p>"If you knew how lonely I was and how unhappy, you would have a little mercy."</p>
<p>His voice was strangely sincere.</p>
<p>"You think me a charlatan because I can do things that are unknown to you. You look upon me with disgust and scorn. You don't give me a chance to explain everything to you."</p>
<p>"It can make no difference to you how I look upon you," she whispered.</p>
<p>She did not know why his soft, low voice produced such a mysterious effect on her. Her pulse began to beat more quickly.</p>
<p>"It makes all the difference in the world. It is horrible to think of your contempt. You turn your eyes away from me as though I were unclean."</p>
<p>She turned her chair a little and looked at him. She was amazed at the change in his appearance. His eyes had a new expression; they were so tender now, and they were full of tears. Margaret had never seen so much unhappiness on a man's face, and she felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be unkind to you," she said. "But let us talk about something else."</p>
<p>For a moment he kept silence. He was looking at a copy of "La Gioconda" which hung on the wall. Suddenly he began to speak. He spoke of Leonardo da Vinci, mixing his own fantasies with the words of different essays on art, which, so wonderful was his memory, he seemed to know by heart. His voice, low and musical, intoxicated Margaret with its beauty. She was horribly fascinated by his imagination and responded to his words like a delicate instrument on which he could play any tune he wanted. At last he stopped. His eyes were fixed upon hers. She neither moved nor spoke. She seemed to be under a spell.</p>
<p>"I want to do something for you in return for what you have done for me," he said.</p>
<p>He stood up and went to the piano. Margaret was not surprised that he played wonderfully. Yet it was almost incredible that those fat, large hands had such a tenderness of touch. He seemed to put into the notes all his passion, and the instrument had the tremulous emotion of a human being. It was strange and terrifying.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER SIX</p>
<p>Oliver Haddo stopped playing. Neither of them moved. At last Margaret regained her self-control.</p>
<p>"I begin to think you really are a magician," she said softly.</p>
<p>"I could show you strange things, if you wanted to see them," he answered again, raising his eyes to hers.</p>
<p>"I don't think you will ever make me believe in occult philosophy," she laughed.</p>
<p>His voice grew very low, and it was so seductive that Margaret's head reeled.</p>
<p>"Believe me, that for this art nothing is impossible. It commands the elements of the earth and knows the language of the stars. Heaven and Hell are in its province, and all forms, beautiful and ugly; love and hate, life and death are in the power of him who knows its secrets..."</p>
<p>Margaret could not hear what he said. A gradual lethargy seized her, and she had not even the strength to wish to free herself. She seemed bound to him already by mysterious chains.</p>
<p>"If you have powers, show them," she whispered.</p>
<p>(Haddo gave Margaret some magic powder to breathe in and took her to the wonderful and terrifying world of his fantasies. She took part in some festival of hideous lust, and the wickedness of the world was patent to her eyes. Then the spell was dispelled and she realised that she was sitting in the studio and that Haddo stood by her side. Shame overcame her. She hid her face in her hands and burst into tears.)</p>
<p>"Go away," she said. "For God's sake, go."</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment and a strange smile came to his lips.</p>
<p>"When you want me you will find me in the Rue de Vaugiraud, number 209," he said. "I'll write it down for you."</p>
<p>He wrote the address on a sheet of paper that he found on the table. She did not answer. She sobbed as though her heart would break. Suddenly, she realised that Haddo was gone. She had not heard him open the door or close it. She fell on her knees and prayed desperately, as though some terrible danger threatened her.</p>
<p>But when she heard Susie's key in the door, Margaret sprang to her feet. She was afraid that Susie would see her agitation, but Susie was too much annoyed to notice it.</p>
<p>"Nancy has not come," she said irritably. "I can't understand it. I waited till the train came in, but there was no sign of her. I walked about the station for half an hour."</p>
<p>She went to the table, on which had been left the telegram and read it again. She gave a little cry of surprise.</p>
<p>"How silly of me! I had not noticed the postmark. It was sent from Paris. I wonder if someone has played a silly practical joke on me. If I were a suspicious woman," she smiled, "I should think you had sent it yourself to get me out of the way."</p>
<p>The idea occurred to Margaret, that Oliver Haddo was the author of the note. He might have seen Nancy's name on the photograph in Susie's bag. She had no time to think as there was a knock at the door. Margaret, her nerves shattered, gave a cry of terror. She feared that Haddo had returned. But it was Arthur Burdon. She greeted him with passion that was unusual for her, because by nature she was a woman of great self-possession. They began to speak of trivial things. Margaret tried to take part in the conversation, but her voice sounded unnatural. Soon she could control herself no longer and burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Oh, take care of me, Arthur. I'm so afraid that some awful thing will happen to me. Why can't we be married at once? I can't feel safe till I'm your wife."</p>
<p>Arthur comforted her very gently. After all they were to be married in a few weeks. The day had been fixed by her. She listened silently to his words. He was right and she did not know how she could convince him.</p>
<p>"If anything happens to me," she answered, "you will be to blame."</p>
<p>"I promise you that nothing will happen."</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p>
<p>Margaret slept badly, and next day she was unable to work as usual. She was sure that Haddo's sudden illness was a trick by which he wanted to get into the studio. And there he had taken advantage of her pity in order to use his hypnotic power. But no matter how she tried, she could not get the man out of her thoughts. Work could not distract her, and between her and all the actions of everyday life stood Oliver Haddo. Although she repeated to herself that she wanted never to see him again, Margaret could hardly resist an overwhelming desire to go to him. Her will had been taken from her, and she was an automaton. He had given her that address because he knew she would use it. She did not know why she wanted to go to him; she had nothing to say to him; she knew only that it was necessary to go.</p>
<p>Instead of going to the class, which was held at six in the evening, she hurried to the address that Oliver Haddo had given her. She walked along the crowded street stealthily, as though afraid that someone would see her, and her heart was beating violently. She ran up the stairs and knocked at the door. In a moment Oliver Haddo stood before her. He did not seem astonished, that she was there.</p>
<p>"I've been waiting for you," he said.</p>
<p>"You knew I should come."</p>
<p>"I knew."</p>
<p>"What have I done to you that you make me so unhappy? I want you to leave me alone."</p>
<p>"I shall not prevent you from going out if you want to go. The door is open."</p>
<p>Her heart beat quickly and she remained silent. She knew that she did not want to go. There was something that drew her strangely to him, and she could not resist.</p>
<p>He began to talk with that low voice of his that thrilled her with a curious magic. He told her of magnificent Eastern palaces and of the moonlight nights in the desert, of the sunsets with their splendour and of the crowded streets at noon. The beauty of the East rose before her, and life itself seemed open to her, a life of freedom, a life of extraordinary knowledge. She shuddered at the comparison between the dull existence which awaited her as Arthur's wife and this bright, full life. But it was possible for her also to enjoy the wonders of the world. She felt a sudden desire for adventures. As though fire passed through her, she sprang to her feet and stood with flashing eyes, bright with multi-coloured pictures that his imagination presented. Oliver Haddo stood too, and they faced one another. Then with a quick movement he took her in his arms and kissed her lips.</p>
<p>She looked at him. "I think I love you," she said, hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Now you must go," he said.</p>
<p>He opened the door, and, without another word, she went.</p>
<p>Since then Margaret every day felt that uncontrollable desire to go to him. There was always that violent hunger of the soul which called her to him, and the only happy hours she had were those spent in his company. She could not now imagine her life apart from his. Sometimes, suffering agonies of remorse, she would lie in bed at night and think with shame of the way she was using Arthur. But things had gone too far now, and she could not change them.</p>
<p>At last Haddo thought the time came for the final step.</p>
<p>"It may interest you to know that I'm leaving Paris on Thursday," he said one afternoon.</p>
<p>She jumped to her feet and stared at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>"But what will become of me?"</p>
<p>"You will marry the excellent Mr Burdon."</p>
<p>"You know I cannot live without you. How can you be so cruel?"</p>
<p>"Then the only alternative is that you should marry me."</p>
<p>She sank helplessly into her chair. Because she had refused to think of the future, it had never occurred to her that the time must come when it would be necessary to leave Haddo or to join her life with his for ever. It would be madness. Margaret realised that. Though an irresistible passion bound her to this man, she hated and feared him. She remembered Arthur's great love and all that he had done for her and felt disgust for herself. She sprang up.</p>
<p>"Let me go from here! I wish I'd never seen you. I don't know what you've done with me."</p>
<p>He opened the door and stood at the threshold, with a smile on his face. His eyes were hard and cruel.</p>
<p>"Go," he said.</p>
<p>She bent her head and ran before him. To get home she passed through the gardens of Luxembourg, but her legs failed her and she sank upon a bench. The bell of Saint Sulpice church was ringing for a service. Margaret walked slowly to the church and sat down on a bench in a corner. She hoped that the music would rest her soul and she would be able to pray. The music was beautiful but it did not move her. For her the service had no meaning, and in those ceremonies she could find no comfort. She felt completely lost. "God has abandoned me," she repeated. "God has abandoned me."</p>
<p>Next day, her eyes red with tears, she dragged herself to Haddo's door. When he opened it, she went in without a word. She sat down, and he watched her in silence.</p>
<p>"I am ready to marry you whenever you like," she said at last.</p>
<p>Haddo told her that they could be married early enough on the Thursday morning to catch a train for England. She left everything in his hands.</p>
<p>"I'm awfully unhappy," she said without any emotions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Wednesday happened to be Arthur's birthday, and he asked Margaret to dine with him alone. They had arranged to eat at a fashionable restaurant on the other side of the river, and soon after seven they met.</p>
<p>Margaret had never been in better spirits. The champagne went quickly to her head, and she talked charming nonsense. Arthur was very proud and very happy. They talked of all the things they would do when they were married. They talked of the places they must go to, of their home and of the beautiful things with which they would fill it. They returned at Margaret's house and she held out her hand to him smiling.</p>
<p>"Good night."</p>
<p>"It's dreadful to think that I must spend some hours without seeing you. When may I come tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Not in the morning, because I shall be too busy. Come at twelve."</p>
<p>She remembered that her train started exactly at that hour. The door was opened, and with a little wave of the hand she disappeared.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p>
<p>Susie stared without comprehension at the note that announced Margaret's marriage. It was sent from the Gare du Nord and ran as follows:</p>
<p>When you receive this I shall be on my way to London. I was married to Oliver Haddo this morning. I love him as I never loved Arthur. I have not told him anything because I had gone too far to make an explanation possible. Please tell him.</p>
<p>Margaret.</p>
<p>Susie did not know what to do nor what to think. There was a knock at the door, and she knew it must be Arthur. She decided quickly that it was impossible to break the news to him at once. Making up her mind, she opened the door.</p>
<p>"... Oh, I'm so sorry. Margaret isn't here," she said. "A friend of hers is ill and sent for her suddenly."</p>
<p>"What a pity!" answered Arthur. "Mrs Bloomfield as usual, I suppose. Margaret has spent nearly every afternoon with her for some days."</p>
<p>Susie did not answer. This was the first time she had heard of Mrs Bloomfield's illness, and it was news for her that Margaret visited her.</p>
<p>"Won't you come back at five o'clock?" she said.</p>
<p>"Oh, all right. Then I'll come back at five."</p>
<p>He nodded and went out. Susie read the brief note once more, and asked herself if it could possibly be true. She went to Margaret's room and saw that everything was in its place. But then she noticed that a number of letters had disappeared. She went out. At the door it occurred to her to ask the concierge if she knew where Margaret had gone that morning.</p>
<p>"Yes, mademoiselle," answered the old woman. "I heard her tell the coachman to go to the British Consulate."</p>
<p>Susie drove then to Mrs Bloomfield and asked her about Margaret.</p>
<p>"I've not seen Margaret for three weeks," said the invalid.</p>
<p>"Haven't you? I thought she dropped in quite often." Susie spoke as though the matter was of no importance. She asked herself where Margaret could have spent those afternoons. On leaving Mrs Bloomfield she went to the Consulate and learnt that Margaret and Haddo had been married. Then nothing remained but to go home and wait for Arthur.</p>
<p>At last he came. He entered joyfully and looked around. "Is Margaret not here yet?" he asked with surprise. "Won't you sit down?"</p>
<p>He did not notice that her voice was hoarse, nor that she tried not to look at him.</p>
<p>"Mr Burden, I have something to say to you. It will cause you very great pain."</p>
<p>He noticed now the hoarseness of her tone. He sprang to his feet and a terrible thought flashed across his brain. Something horrible had happened to Margaret. She was ill. His terror was so great that he trembled from head to foot. Susie tried to speak, but she could not. Her voice broke, and she began to cry. She gave him the letter.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?"</p>
<p>He looked at her without understanding. Then she told him all that she had learnt that day and the places where she had been.</p>
<p>Arthur sat down and leaned his head on his hands. They remained in perfect silence. Susie suffered as much as he did. Her impulse was to throw herself on her knees, and kiss his hands, and comfort him; but she knew that he was interested in her only because she was Margaret's friend. At last he got up and taking his pipe from his pocket filled it silently. His face expressed such suffering that it was terrible to look upon.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it's true," he answered. "I can't believe it."</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door, and Arthur rushed to the door.</p>
<p>"Perhaps she's come back."</p>
<p>But it was Dr Porhoet.</p>
<p>"How do you do?" said the Frenchman. "What's happening?"</p>
<p>He looked round and caught the dismay that was on the faces of Arthur and Susie.</p>
<p>"Where is Miss Margaret? I thought you must be giving a party. I received a telegram from Mr Haddo this morning."</p>
<p>He took it from his pocket and handed it to Susie. She read it and passed it to Arthur. It said:</p>
<p>"Come to the studio at five. High jinks. Oliver Haddo."</p>
<p>"Margaret was married to Mr Haddo this morning," said Arthur quietly. "They have gone to England."</p>
<p>Susie quickly told the doctor the few facts they knew. He was as astonished and upset, as they.</p>
<p>"But what is the explanation of it all?" he asked.</p>
<p>Arthur shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"She cared for Haddo more than she cared for me, I suppose."</p>
<p>A spasm of pain passed over his face as he remembered how tender she had been the night before. The thought of Margaret in that man's arms tortured him as though his flesh were tom with iron hooks.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it's not true. Perhaps she'll return," he cried out.</p>
<p>"Would you take her back if she came to you?" asked Susie.</p>
<p>"Do you think that anything she can do has the power to make me love her less? There must be reasons of which we know nothing that caused her to do all she has done. If I could only be sure that she would be happy. Her future terrifies me."</p>
<p>Porhoet got up and walked across the room.</p>
<p>"I wonder why Haddo sent me that telegram," he said. "What can it mean?"</p>
<p>Susie turned to Arthur.</p>
<p>"Do you remember that day at the fair when you called him a charlatan? I warned you, I told you that he had made up his mind to avenge himself, but you laughed at me. You know why Haddo sent Dr Porhoet here today? He was present at his humiliation and he wished him to be present at his triumph."</p>
<p>"I think that Miss Boyd is right," murmured the doctor. "After all, he couldn't hurt you more. He knew that you wanted nothing in the world more than to make Margaret your wife, and he has not only prevented that, but he has married her himself. And he could only do it by poisoning her mind; he must have completely changed her personality."</p>
<p>"Ah, I feel that," cried out Arthur. "If Margaret has broken her word to me, if she has gone to him, it's because it's not the Margaret I know. Some devil must have taken possession of her."</p>
<p>"Is it possible that Haddo cast some spell upon her that would make her unable to resist his will?" said Susie. "Perhaps he has powers we can hardly imagine."</p>
<p>For a while they remained silent. It was Dr Porhoet who spoke at last.</p>
<p>"But even if there is some truth in Miss Boyd's suppositions, I don't see how it can help you. You cannot do anything. Her letter shows that she has married Haddo of her own free will and does not want to be released from him."</p>
<p>What he said seemed true, and there was nothing to object to it.</p>
<p>"The only thing is to grin and to bear it," said Arthur, rising.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" asked Susie.</p>
<p>"I think I'll get away from Paris. Here everything will remind me of what I have lost. I must get back to my work. If Margaret writes to you, I should like you to tell her that I will never reproach her for what she has done, and I will always do everything that she wants."</p>
<p>When Susie was alone she began to sob broken-heartedly, not for herself, but because Arthur suffered so much.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER NINE</p>
<p>Susie felt it impossible to stay in the deserted studio any longer, and accepted a friend's invitation to spend the winter in Italy. Margaret had not written to her, and she could not make herself write to her. In Rome Susie had news of Haddo and his wife. They had spent some time there, and the little English circle was still talking of their eccentricities. Haddo had excited attention by the extravagance of his costume and manner; and Margaret by her beauty. She was seen in her box at the opera every night, and her diamonds were the envy of all women. But suddenly the pair had disappeared without saying a word to anybody. It was reported that they were now in Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>Susie had intended to pass the spring on the Riviera, but when she heard that the Haddos were there, she hesitated. She did not want to run the risk of seeing them, and yet she had a strong desire to find out exactly how things were going. At last curiosity won and she went to Monte Carlo. After two or three days she saw them at the tables, but they were so absorbed in their game that they did not notice her. Margaret was playing, but Haddo stood behind her and directed her movements. Susie was unable to recognize in her the girl who had been her friend. What struck her most was that there was in Margaret's expression an extraordinary likeness to Haddo's. In spite of her beauty, she had Oliver's evil look which suggested that she saw with his eyes.</p>
<p>They had won great sums that evening. Taking up the money, Haddo touched her on the shoulder, and she followed him.</p>
<p>Susie learned that the Haddos had rooms at the most expensive of the hotels. They knew few English except those who had bad reputations, but seemed to prefer the society of those foreigners whose wealth and eccentricities made them the centre of that little world. Margaret moved among all those odd people with a cold mysteriousness that excited everybody's curiosity. Oliver's eccentric imagination invented whimsical festivities and orgies that were held in the dark sitting-room of the hotel. He wanted to revive the mystical ceremonies of old religions imitating those he had seen in Eastern places. Haddo was thought to be involved in occult studies, and some said that he was occupied with the Magnum Opus, the greatest and most fantastic of alchemical experiments. It was also said that he was attempting to create living beings. He had explained to somebody that magical receipts existed for the manufacture of homunculi.</p>
<p>No one understood his true relations with his wife, and it was said that he was sometimes very cruel to her. Susie's heart sank when she heard this; but several times when she saw Margaret, she seemed in the highest spirits. Then the same thing that had happened in Rome happened here again; they suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Susie had not been to London for some time, and as the spring advanced she remembered that her friends had invited her. Though she would not confess it to herself, her desire to see Arthur was the strongest of her motives. She knew that he would never care for her, but she was glad to be his friend.</p>
<p>In London she wrote to Arthur, and he invited her to the opera. Susie was terrified at the change that had taken place in him. He looked ten years older, he had lost weight, and his hair was white. But what most struck her was the change of his expression. The look of pain which she had seen on his face that last evening in the studio has now become settled, so that it changed its countenance. He was more silent than ever, and when he spoke, it was a strange low voice that seemed to come from a long way off.</p>
<p>He seemed glad to see her and asked about her travels with interest. He told her of his work. Besides his duties at the two hospitals, his teaching and private practice, he gave lectures and was editing a journal on surgery.</p>
<p>"How on earth can you find time to do so much?" asked Susie.</p>
<p>"I can do with less sleep than I used," he answered. "It almost doubles my working day."</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly and looked down. His remark had given him away and showed his sufferings which he tried to conceal. They sat in silence. At last Susie said, "I was never able to give Margaret your message. She did not write to me."</p>
<p>A look of pain on his face seemed stronger, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>"I saw her in Monte Carlo," said Susie. "I thought you would like to hear about her."</p>
<p>"I don't see that it can do any good," he answered.</p>
<p>Susie made a little hopeless gesture. She didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>When the opera was over and they went out into the vestibule, they saw doctor Arbuthnot, whom Susie had met on the Riviera and who was a colleague of Arthur's at the hospital.</p>
<p>"The very people I wanted to see!" he cried out. "Now look here, do me a great favour. I'm giving a supper party at the Savoy, and you must come by all means. I'll introduce you to a man and his wife who will thrill you. They are so strange."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I must get home," said Arthur. "I have a lot of work to do."</p>
<p>But Susie looked at him with such an appeal that he forced himself to smile and accept the invitation. They agreed to meet at the Savoy.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the restaurant Arbuthnot came up to them and took their arms.</p>
<p>"Come along. We're waiting for you. I'll introduce you to everybody, and then we'll go in to supper."</p>
<p>They walked down the steps to the foyer and he led them to a group of people. They found themselves face to face with Oliver Haddo and Margaret. Arbuthnot introduced them. He did not notice that Arthur had become deathly pale and that Margaret was petrified with astonishment. Haddo, smiling, stepped forward. He seemed to enjoy the situation.</p>
<p>"Mr Burdon is an old friend of ours," he said. "In fact, it was he who introduced me to my wife."</p>
<p>He held out his hand, and Susie took it. She shook hands with Margaret. During the supper Haddo ate and drank with great appetite. He took as usual the whole conversation upon himself, and Susie had to admit that he was at his best.</p>
<p>Margaret was as beautiful as ever, but her dress was much too gorgeous. She talked and laughed as much as her husband; perhaps she was trying to show that she was happy. She had been drinking glass after glass of wine and told anecdotes together with Oliver Haddo. But if his were witty immoral, hers were simply indecent. Everybody laughed, but Arthur sat in stony silence. He felt horribly uncomfortable. He was ashamed. He did not dare to look at Margaret. Margaret seemed quite unconscious of the effect she had produced and went on talking and laughing.</p>
<p>At last the lights were put out, and Arthur's agony ended. Margaret shook hands with him quite lightly.</p>
<p>"You must come and see us one day. We've got rooms at the Carlton."</p>
<p>He bowed and did not answer.</p>
<p>Susie had gone to the dressing-room to get her cloak. She stood at the door when Margaret came out.</p>
<p>"Can we drop you anywhere?" asked Margaret. "You must come and see us when you have nothing better to do."</p>
<p>Susie looked back. Arthur was standing in front of them looking down at the ground in complete abstraction.</p>
<p>"Do you see him?" she asked in a low voice trembling with indignation. "That's what you have made him. Do you know that he's killing himself on your account? He can't sleep at night. He's suffered the tortures of the damned. Oh, I hope you'll suffer as he's suffered!"</p>
<p>"I wonder that you blame me," said Margaret. "You should be rather grateful."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You're not going to deny that you've loved him passionately from the first day you saw him? Do you think I didn't see that you cared for him in Paris? You care for him now more than ever."</p>
<p>Susie felt suddenly sick at heart. She had never thought that her secret was discovered.</p>
<p>Margaret gave a little bitter laugh and passed by.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER TEN</p>
<p>Arthur Burdon spent two or three days in a state of complete uncertainty, but at last the idea he had in mind grew so compelling that it overcame all objections. He went to the Carlton and asked for Margaret. He had learnt from the porter that Haddo was out and so he hoped to find Margaret alone. When he was shown into the drawing-room he found Margaret sitting at the table. She neither read nor worked.</p>
<p>"You told me I might call upon you," said Arthur.</p>
<p>She stood up without answering and grew deathly pale.</p>
<p>"Why have you come?" she said hoarsely.</p>
<p>"I thought that I might be able to help you," he answered softly.</p>
<p>"I want no help. I'm perfectly happy. I have nothing to say to you."</p>
<p>She spoke hurriedly and nervously and her eyes were fixed anxiously on the door as though she feared that someone would come in.</p>
<p>"I feel that we have much to say to one another."</p>
<p>"He'll know," she cried suddenly. "Do you think anything can be concealed from him?"</p>
<p>Arthur glanced at her. He was horrified by the terror that was in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I want you to know that I do not blame you for anything you did. No action of yours can lessen my affection for you."</p>
<p>She suddenly burst into tears. She fell on her knees by Arthur's side and seized his hands.</p>
<p>"Oh, why did you come here? Why do you torture me by saying such things? Did you think I didn't see how you suffered? My heart bled when I looked at your face and your tortured eyes. Oh, Arthur, Arthur, you must forgive me."</p>
<p>"But there's nothing to forgive, darling."</p>
<p>She looked at him strangely.</p>
<p>"You say that but you don't really think it, and yet if you only knew that all I have suffered is because of you."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" asked Arthur.</p>
<p>She tried her best to be calm.</p>
<p>"He never loved me, he would never have thought of me if he hadn't wanted to hurt you. He hated you, and he's made me what I am so that you might suffer. It isn't I who lied to you and left you and caused you all this unhappiness. He has some dreadful power over me so that I've been like wax in his hands. All my will has disappeared. And if I try to resist... My life is hell, and his revenge is complete."</p>
<p>Margaret's agitation was terrible. This was the first time that she had ever spoken to anybody of all these things, and how the long restraint had burst as burst the waters of a dam."</p>
<p>"You always laughed at his words. But I know. Oh, I can't explain it, but I've seen things with my own eyes that are against all comprehension. I tell you, he has powers of the most awful kind. Sometimes I think I shall go mad with the terror of it all."</p>
<p>"Look here," said Arthur. "You must come away at once."</p>
<p>"I can't leave him. It's no use."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because I love him with all my soul."</p>
<p>"Margaret!"</p>
<p>"I hate him. He fills me with disgust. And yet I do not know what there is in my blood that draws me to him against my will. I can't help it."</p>
<p>A cold sweat came over Arthur, and he grew more pale than ever. He realised that he was in the presence of a mystery against which he could not fight.</p>
<p>"But if he doesn't love you, what does he want you for?"</p>
<p>She looked in Arthur's eyes. She was now quite calm.</p>
<p>"I think he wishes to use me for a magical operation. I don't know if he is mad or not. But I think he intends to try some horrible experiment and he wants me for its success."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by saying he wants you?"</p>
<p>"He wants my life."</p>
<p>It was more than Arthur could stand. He saw on the table a whisky bottle. He poured some whisky into a glass and gave it to Margaret.</p>
<p>"Drink it," he said.</p>
<p>Obediently, she put it to her lips.</p>
<p>"Now come with me."</p>
<p>He took her arm and led her down the stairs. He passed through the hall quickly. There was a cab just at the door, and he told her to get in. He directed the driver to the house in which Susie lived and looked at Margaret. She had fainted immediately she got into the cab. He told Susie what had happened and what he wanted of her. She promised willingly to do all he wished.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Arthur hired a little cottage in Hampshire, hoping that among the most charming, restful scenery in England Margaret would quickly regain her strength; and as soon as it was possible Susie took her down. But she was much afraid.</p>
<p>For a week Margaret could not be moved. Although her illness was neither long nor serious, she felt as if she had been for months at the point of death. But at last it seemed necessary to discuss the future. Nothing had been heard of Oliver Haddo, and Margaret willingly agreed to institute a suit for divorce. She was eager to be set free. She was growing stronger and more cheerful; her charming laughter rang through the little house as it had been in the Paris studio. But presently a change came over her. As the day of trial drew nearer Margaret became excited and nervous, her gaiety abandoned her, and she was silent and gloomy. When Susie asked her what troubled her, she said: "I'm afraid that something is going to happen." She could not explain what she meant.</p>
<p>One day when Susie came home she did not find Margaret in her room. There was a note on the table.</p>
<p>"It's no use. I can't help it. I've gone back to him. Don't trouble about me any more. It's quite hopeless."</p>
<p>Susie's first thought was for Arthur; once more she had to break the dreadful news to him. At that moment the door was opened, and Arthur came in.</p>
<p>Susie gave a cry of terror and turned pale.</p>
<p>"I wanted to come to see you," she said. "How did you find out?"</p>
<p>"Haddo sent me a box of chocolates early this morning with a card on which was written: 'I think the odd trick is mine.'"</p>
<p>He read Margaret's note and was silent for a long time.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid she's right," he said at last. "It seems quite hopeless. The man has some power over her against which we can't fight."</p>
<p>Susie wondered whether his strong skepticism was failing at last. She did not doubt that Oliver was able to affect his wife even at a distance, and was convinced now that Margaret's restlessness of the last few days was due to this mysterious power. She could not resist and had gone to him instinctively, like steel to a magnet.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that one can do. One can't go to the police and say that a man has cast a magic spell on his wife. I can do nothing though I'm convinced that Margaret is very unhappy."</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
<p>Returning to London after Margaret's disappearance Burdon had thrown himself again into the work trying to distract himself from his thoughts. But it did not help him. He was sure that a great danger threatened Margaret. He could not tell what it was, but the idea was there always, night and day. He dreamed that she was at the point of death, and heavy chains prevented him from stretching out a hand to help her. At last he could stand it no more. He told another surgeon that private business forced him to leave London, and put the work into his hands. He supposed that Haddo had taken Margaret to his house to Skene. He went to Paris to see Susie and Doctor Porhoet. They tried to reason with him, but saw that it was quite useless.</p>
<p>"What do you want us to do?" asked Susie.</p>
<p>"I want you both to come to England with me at once. If we start now we can catch the evening train."</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake, calm down a little," said Susie. "I'm convinced that you'll find Margaret safe and sound."</p>
<p>He did not answer. He gave a sigh of relief as they drove to the station.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Susie never forgot the horror of that journey to England. They arrived in London early in the morning and without stopping drove to Skene. It was a small place with one public house serving as a hotel to the rare travellers who stayed there.</p>
<p>They tried to find out something about the Haddos. Oliver was the local magnate, and his wealth and eccentricity made him a usual topic of conversation. The landlady of the hotel called him mad; she told them of Haddo's evil influence on the crops and cattle of farmers who had aroused his anger. As soon as he could do so, Arthur asked about Margaret. The landlady shrugged her shoulders. No one knew anything certain about her. "People say the poor lady is dead," she said.</p>
<p>"What did she die of?" asked Susie, her eyes on Arthur.</p>
<p>"They say it was heart disease," answered the landlady. "Poor thing! It's a happy release for her."</p>
<p>Susie seized Arthur's arm.</p>
<p>"Arthur, Arthur. You couldn't have done anything, if you had been here. If Margaret died of heart disease, your suspicions were quite without ground."</p>
<p>His silence terrified her more than anything. The landlady was on the point of leaving when Arthur stopped her.</p>
<p>"How do you know that Mrs Haddo died of heart disease?" he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>"Dr Richardson told me so."</p>
<p>"Where does he live?"</p>
<p>"Why, sir, he lives at the white house near the station." She could not understand why Arthur asked these questions.</p>
<p>"Thank you. You can go."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Susie.</p>
<p>He turned on her with a sudden rage.</p>
<p>"I'm going to see this doctor. Margaret's heart was as good as mine. I'll put a rope round that man's neck, and if the law doesn't help me, I'll kill him myself. I know that Margaret didn't die naturally. I'll never have a rest so long as that fellow lives."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Dr Richardson was a little man of fifty-five with a white beard and prominent blue eyes.</p>
<p>Arthur was shown into the consulting room and shortly told him about the reason of his visit.</p>
<p>"I have just learnt of the death of Mrs Haddo. I was her oldest friend. I came to you in the hope that you would be able to tell me something about it."</p>
<p>Dr Richardson gave him a suspicious glance.</p>
<p>"I don't know why you came to me instead of her husband. He will be able to tell you all that you wish to know."</p>
<p>"I came to you as a fellow-doctor," answered Arthur. He pointed to his card, which Dr Richardson still held.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, Mr Burdon?"</p>
<p>"I should be very much obliged if you would tell me how Mrs Haddo died."</p>
<p>"It was a very simple case of endocarditis. I don't think there is anything I can tell you."</p>
<p>"Did you have a post-mortem?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not. In the first place there was no need as the cause of death was perfectly clear, and secondly, you must know that her husband was against anything of the sort."</p>
<p>Arthur was silent for a moment. It was evident that the little man would do anything to avoid social scandal. Still Arthur went on.</p>
<p>"I think I must tell you, Dr Richardson, that I don't believe that this lady's death was due to natural causes. I want to make an exhumation and I hope you will assist me in every possible way."</p>
<p>"I shall do nothing of the kind. There is no need for exhumation and I shall do everything in my power to prevent it."</p>
<p>He flung the door open. Susie and Dr Porhoet walked out and Arthur looking down thoughtfully, followed them. Dr Richardson slammed the street door angrily.</p>

<p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p>
<p>The three of them drove slowly back to the inn.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do now?" asked Susie.</p>
<p>For a long time Arthur made no reply and Susie thought he hadn't heard her. At last he broke the silence.</p>
<p>"I see that I can do nothing by ordinary methods. This is only my own conviction that Margaret was murdered but I can't prove it."</p>
<p>"After all it's just possible that she really died of heart disease."</p>
<p>Arthur gave Susie a long look. He seemed to consider her words.</p>
<p>"Perhaps there are means to make sure," he replied at last thoughtfully as though he was talking to himself.</p>
<p>"What are they?"</p>
<p>Arthur did not answer. When they came to the door of the inn he stopped.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" Susie asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"I will do nothing till I have made quite sure that Margaret was killed."</p>
<p>He turned and walked quickly away. Susie sat at the open window and looked at the stars. She thought of Margaret, of her beauty and her miserable end and she began to cry quietly. She knew enough of the facts now to realise the poor girl was not to blame for anything that had happened. A cruel fate had fallen upon her, and she had been powerless before it. The hours passed and still Arthur did not return. But at last he came in. He put down his hat and sat down. For a long time he looked silently at Dr Porhoet.</p>
<p>"What is it, my friend?" asked the doctor at last.</p>
<p>"Do you remember you told me once of an experiment you made in Alexandria?" he said after some hesitation. "You told me that you took a boy and when he looked in a magic mirror he saw things which he could not possibly have known."</p>
<p>"I remember very well," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"I laughed at it that time. I was convinced that the boy had cheated you."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Later I thought of that story often. Some hidden comers of my memory opened and I remembered strange things. Was I the boy who looked in the mirror?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the doctor quietly.</p>
<p>A profound silence fell upon them while Susie and the doctor stared at Arthur. They wondered what was in his mind. At last he turned and faced them. He spoke hoarsely.</p>
<p>"I must see Margaret again."</p>
<p>"Arthur, you're mad!" cried Susie.</p>
<p>He went up to Dr Porhoet and putting his hands on his shoulders looked fixedly into his eyes.</p>
<p>"You have studied occult sciences. You know all that can be known of them. I want you to show her to me."</p>
<p>"I don't understand what you want."</p>
<p>"I want you to bring her to me so that I may speak with her so that I may find out the truth."</p>
<p>"Do you think I am God, that I raise men from the dead?"</p>
<p>"I want you to call her spirit. If she died a natural death we shall have no power over her, but if her death was violent, perhaps her spirit is still bound to the earth. I tell you I must be certain. I want to see her once more and afterwards I shall know what to do."</p>
<p>"I cannot, I cannot," cried out the doctor.</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake, help me!" exclaimed Arthur. "If you have any care for my happiness do this for me."</p>
<p>"It's madness," muttered the doctor. He was greatly moved by Arthur's appeal. At last he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"After all it will do no harm."</p>
<p>"You will help me?" cried Arthur.</p>
<p>"If it can give you any peace or any satisfaction, I am willing to do what I can. But I warn you to be prepared for a great disappointment."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When they came down in the morning and greeted one another it was clear that none of them had slept.</p>
<p>"You haven't changed your mind?" asked Dr Porhoet.</p>
<p>"No, I haven't."</p>
<p>The doctor hesitated. "It will be necessary if you wish to follow the rules of the old necromancers to fast through the whole day."</p>
<p>"I am ready to do anything."</p>
<p>"It won't be hard to me," said Susie with a little hysterical laugh. "I feel I couldn't eat a thing even if I tried."</p>
<p>Arthur was too restless to remain indoors and walked away.</p>
<p>The day, the long summer day, passed slowly. At last the lights in the village were put out little by little and everybody slept. Susie and Dr Porhoet had lighted the lamp and they were sitting beside it. The window was wide open but the air was heavy and it was difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>"Why does not Arthur come?" said Susie. She felt an extraordinary oppression and she panted for breath. At last they heard a step on the road outside and Arthur appeared at the window.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to come?" he said.</p>
<p>"We've been waiting for you."</p>
<p>They joined him bringing the few things that Dr Porhoet had said were necessary, and they walked along the lonely road that led to Skene. The way seemed very long. They did not speak but walked on. They moved like figures in a dream, as though they acted under the influence of somebody's will. Suddenly the road stopped, and they found themselves at the gates of Skene.</p>
<p>They walked with difficulty through closely planted trees. It seemed that they went a long way. Susie's heart beat fast with anxiety.</p>
<p>Then Arthur stopped them, and he pointed in front of him. Through an opening in the trees they saw the house. All the windows were dark except those just under the roof and from them came bright lights.</p>
<p>"Those are attics which he uses as a laboratory. You see, he is working now. There is no one else in the house."</p>
<p>Susie was curiously fascinated by the flaming lights. There was an awful mystery in these unknown labours which absorbed Oliver Haddo night after night till the sun rose. What horrible things were done there, hidden from the eyes of man?</p>
<p>Arthur took her hand and led her on. At last they found themselves in front of a green space formed by four cross-ways. In the middle of it a stone bench gleamed in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Let's stay here," said Arthur. He gave Dr Porhoet two flat brass bowls that they had brought. He stood by Susie's side while the doctor busied himself with his preparations. They saw him bend to the ground. Presently, there was a crackling of wood, and from the bowls red flames shot up. They did not know what he burnt but there were heavy clouds of smoke, and a strong, aromatic odour filled the air. The bowed figure of the doctor was quite mysterious. He looked like some old alchemist busied with unnatural things. Susie's heart began to beat fast. She was getting madly frightened and stretched out her hand so that she could touch Arthur. Silently he put his arm through hers. And now the doctor was drawing strange signs upon the ground. Then he put more twiggs upon the braziers and the flames sprang up once more, cutting the darkness sharply as with a sword.</p>
<p>"Now come," he said.</p>
<p>A sudden terror seized Susie, but she recovered her courage and stepped forward. Dr Porhoet told her where to stand. Arthur took his place in front of her.</p>
<p>"You must not move till I allow you," said the doctor. "If you go outside the figure I have drawn, I cannot protect you."</p>
<p>For a moment he stood in perfect silence. Then he began to say strange words in Latin. Arthur stood immobile as a rock. The flames died away, and they saw one another only by the glow of the ashes, dimly, like persons in a vision of death. Susie clenched her hands so that not to faint.</p>
<p>All at once Susie started, for the old man's voice was cut by a sudden blow of wind. A storm seemed to have fallen upon them. They were in the centre of a hurricane. They felt the earth sway, and the wind was roaring about them, and the doctor raising his voice tried in vain to command it. But the strangest thing of all was that where they stood there was no sign of the storm. The air about them was as still as it had been before, and not a hair on Susie's head was moved. And it was terrible to be in a calm that was almost unnatural.</p>
<p>Suddenly Dr Porhoet raised his voice and cried out something in that unknown language. Then he called upon Margaret. He called her name three times! "Margaret, Margaret, Margaret."</p>
<p>Without a pause between, as quickly as a stone falls to the ground the storm which was everywhere about them ceased. And there was a silence, so profound that it looked like the silence of death.</p>
<p>And then as though out of nothingness they heard very distinctly the sound of a woman weeping. Susie's heart stood still. They heard the sound of a woman weeping, and they recognized the voice of Margaret. A moan of pain burst from Arthur's lips, and he was on the point of rushing forward. But Dr Porhoet quickly put out his hand to prevent him. The sound was heartbreaking, the crying of a woman who had lost all hope, the crying of a woman terrified.</p>
<p>And in a moment in spite of the heavy darkness of the starless night Arthur saw her. She was seated on the stone bench and did not even try to hide her face. She looked at the ground and the tears fell down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Then Arthur knew that all his suspicions were true.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>
<p>Arthur would not leave Skene. He spent long hours by himself in the country and Susie and the doctor had no idea what he did. Several days went by. At last Susie decided to make one more attempt. It was late at night, and they sat with open windows in the sitting-room of the inn.</p>
<p>"Arthur, you must tell us what you are going to do," she said. "It is useless to stay here. We are all ill and nervous. We want you to come away with us tomorrow."</p>
<p>"You can go if you like," he said. "I shall remain till that man is dead."</p>
<p>"It is madness to talk like that. You can do nothing."</p>
<p>"I have made up my mind."</p>
<p>"The law can offer you no help and what else can you do?"</p>
<p>"If I can do nothing else, I shall kill him myself."</p>
<p>She could think of nothing to say, and for a while they remained in silence. It was so still in the room, as though it was empty. Suddenly there was a loud rattle of thunder. It was so loud that it seemed to be above their heads.</p>
<p>The lamp went out so suddenly that Susie was a little frightened. They were in total darkness. The night was very black, and they could not see the window which opened on to the back yard.</p>
<p>Suddenly Susie's heart sank, and she sprang up.</p>
<p>"There's someone in the room."</p>
<p>She had just uttered these words when she heard Arthur fling himself upon the intruder. She knew at once, by an intuition, that it was Haddo. But how had he come in? What did he want? She tried to cry out, but no sound came from her throat. She knew that an awful struggle was going on. It was a struggle to the death between two men who hated one another but the most terrible part of it was that nothing was heard. She tried to do something but she could not move. They struggled silently, hand to hand, and Arthur knew that his strength was greater. He clenched his teeth and tightened his muscles. It seemed for hours that they struggled.</p>
<p>All at once Haddo collapsed and they fell heavily to the ground. Arthur seized the huge throat and dug his fingers into it; he was strangling him, strangling the life out of him. He knew now that his enemy was in his power at last. He wanted light so that he could see the horror on that fat face, and the deadly fear in his eyes. He forgot everything; he was mad with rage and anger, and hate and sorrow. And at last all was still, and he knew that his enemy was dead. He put one hand over the heart. It would never beat again. The man was dead. Arthur got up from the floor. Susie heard him, and at last she could speak.</p>
<p>"Arthur, what have you done?"</p>
<p>"I've killed him," he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>"O God, what shall we do?"</p>
<p>Arthur began to laugh aloud, hysterically, and in the darkness his laugh was terrifying.</p>
<p>"For God's sake let us have some light."</p>
<p>"I've found the matches," said Dr Porhoet. He lit the lamp and held it forward. They looked down on the floor to see the man who lay there dead. Susie gave a sudden cry of horror.</p>
<p>There was no one there.</p>
<p>Arthur stepped back in terrified surprise. There was no one in the room, living or dead, except the three friends. Susie's self control left her, and she sobbed as though her heart would break. Arthur took her hand.</p>
<p>"It's all right," he said. "You need not be afraid. We're going now to Skene."</p>
<p>She sprang up to her feet, as though to get away from him.</p>
<p>"No, I can't. I'm frightened."</p>
<p>"We must see what it means. We have no time to lose, or the morning will be upon us before we get back."</p>
<p>She tried to stop him.</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake, don't go, Arthur. Something awful may await you there. Don't risk your life."</p>
<p>"There is no danger. I tell you the man is dead."</p>
<p>"If anything happens to you..."</p>
<p>She stopped, she dared not go on. But he seemed to know what she wanted to say.</p>
<p>"I will take no risk because of you. I know that whether I'll live or die is not... indifferent to you."</p>
<p>She looked up and saw that his eyes were fixed upon her. She flushed.</p>
<p>"I will go with you wherever you like," she said.</p>
<p>"Come, then."</p>
<p>They stepped out into the night. The storm had passed away and the stars were shining. They walked quickly. Arthur went in front of them. Dr Porhoet and Susie followed him, side by side. It seemed to them that the horror of the night was passed, and the air was wonderfully refreshing. The sky was beautiful. And at last they came to Skene. Haddo's house stood in the blackness of the night and the windows shone out with bright lights. They walked to the front door and Arthur tried it, but it wouldn't open.</p>
<p>"Will you wait here?" said he. "I can get through one of the windows, and will let you in."</p>
<p>He left them. They stood quietly there with fast beating hearts; they could not guess what they would see. At last they heard a footstep inside the house, and the door was opened. They stood in a large hall, the floor of which was covered with the skins of lions that Haddo had killed in Africa. The walls were decorated with all kinds of armour from the East and Central Africa. Arthur took down a huge battle-axe and swung it in his hand.</p>
<p>"Now come."</p>
<p>Silently, holding their breath, they went through all the rooms.</p>
<p>"How shall we get to the attics?" asked Arthur looking about him with surprise. "There must be some steps leading out of one of the rooms."</p>
<p>They went back and again examined all the rooms, looking for a door that might lead to a staircase, but there was no sign of it. Presently Arthur gave a little laugh, for he saw that a small door in one of the rooms was concealed by a picture. He pressed it and flung it open. They saw a narrow wooden staircase. They walked up and found themselves in front of a door. Arthur tried it, but it was locked. He smiled grimly.</p>
<p>"Will you get back a little," he said. He lifted his axe and swung it down upon the lock. As they stood there Susie distinctly heard a slight noise. There was something alive on the other side of the door. They heard its curious sound: it was not that of a human voice, it was not the crying of an animal, it was extraordinary.</p>
<p>"Come away, Arthur," whispered Susie. "Come away. Something awful will happen to us."</p>
<p>But Arthur did not listen to her. Quickly, without pausing, he began to break the door with the axe. There was a crash, and the door flung open. They had been so long in almost total darkness that they were blinded for an instant by the bright light. And then instinctively they started back, for, as the door opened, a wave of heat came out upon them so that they could hardly breathe. The place was like an oven.</p>
<p>They entered. The room was lit by huge lamps and warmed by a great furnace. Dr Porhoet looked at a thermometer and was astonished at the temperature it indicated. The room was used evidently as a laboratory. On broad tables were huge test-tubes, basins of white porcelain and rows of bottles containing great quantities of different chemicals.</p>
<p>The three friends stood in silence. Arthur's gaze travelled slowly from table to table, he wondered what Haddo's experiments had really been. The air was heavy with a strange odour that made them feel sick. Arthur asked himself where it came from. Then his eyes fell on huge glass vessels that stood on the table near the furnace. Each was covered with a white cloth. They hesitated a moment for they knew that here they were face to face with great mystery. At last Arthur pulled away the cloth from one vessel. None of them spoke. They stared with astonished eyes. For here was a monstrous thing in which the limbs approached nearly to the human. The trunk was almost like that of a human child, except that it was of strange red and grey colour. But the most terrible thing was that at the neck it branched hideously, and there were two heads unnaturally large but having all their features. And as the light fell on it the eyes of each head opened slowly. They had no pigment in them, but were red like the eyes of white rabbits, and they stared for a moment with an odd unseeing glance.</p>
<p>Arthur quickly removed the covering from all the other vessels, and they saw something so awful that Susie had to clench her fists in order not to scream.</p>
<p>"Do you understand what this means?" said Dr Porhoet to Arthur in a trembling voice. "It means that he has discovered the secret of life."</p>
<p>"Was it for these monsters that Margaret was sacrificed in all her beauty?" said Arthur bitterly. "Do you remember the book of Paracelsus in which he speaks of feeding the monsters he has made on human blood?"</p>
<p>The two men looked at one another with sad terrified eyes.</p>
<p>"Come away," said Dr Porhoet. "We must not look at this."</p>
<p>"Yes, for God's sake, let us go," said Susie.</p>
<p>"We haven't finished yet," answered Arthur. "We haven't found the author of all this."</p>
<p>He looked at the room in which they were but there was no door except that by which they had entered. Then he uttered a frightened cry, and stepping forward fell on his knees.</p>
<p>On the other side of the long tables, concealed by instruments so that at first they had not seen him, Oliver Haddo lay on the floor, dead. His blue eyes were staring wide and they seemed larger than they had ever been. They kept still the expression of terror, which they had worn in the moment of his agony, and his heavy face was distorted with deadly fear.</p>
<p>"I told you that I had killed him," said Arthur.</p>
<p>"Now that you have seen, will you come away?" said Susie interrupting him.</p>
<p>"Yes, we must go quickly."</p>
<p>They turned away and with hurried steps walked through the bright attics till they came to the stairs.</p>
<p>"Now go down and wait for me at the door," said Arthur. "I will follow you immediately."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Susie.</p>
<p>"Never mind. Do as I tell you. I have not finished here yet."</p>
<p>They went down the great staircase and waited in the hall. They wondered what Arthur wanted to do. Presently he came running down.</p>
<p>"Be quick," he cried. "We have no time to lose."</p>
<p>"What have you done, Arthur?"</p>
<p>"There's no time to tell you now."</p>
<p>He took Susie's hand. "Now we must run. Come." He dragged her along. Doctor Porhoet hurried on behind them.</p>
<p>They walked very quickly for a while. Now and then Arthur looked back. The night was still quite dark, and the stars shone out in their myriads. At last he stopped.</p>
<p>"Now you can go more slowly," he said.</p>
<p>His voice was different now, it was soft with a good humour that they had not heard in it for many months. He appeared relieved.</p>
<p>"Let's wait here and see the sun rise," said Susie.</p>
<p>"As you wish."</p>
<p>He put his arm affectionately round her shoulders to support her.</p>
<p>They stood all three of them, and Susie took in deep, joyful breaths of the sweet air of dawn. But she noticed that Arthur, unlike herself and Dr Porhoet, did not look towards the east. His eyes were fixed upon the place from which they had come. What did he look for in the darkness of the west? She turned round, and a cry broke from her lips, for the shadows there were lurid with a deep red glow.</p>
<p>"It looks like a fire," she said.</p>
<p>"It is. Skene is burning."</p>
<p>Skene was burning. In a little while there would be no trace of all those crimes and all those horrors. Now it was one mass of flame. It looked like some primitive furnace, where the gods worked unheard miracles.</p>
<p>"Arthur, what have you done?"</p>
<p>He did not answer. He put his arm about her shoulders again, so that she had to turn round.</p>
<p>"Look, the sun is rising."</p>
<p>In the east, a long ray of light climbed up the sky, and the sun, yellow and round, appeared upon the face of the earth.</p>
